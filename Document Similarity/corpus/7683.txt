 British naval lieutenant Alan Querdillon becomes a POW during the Battle of Crete during World War II. He awakens in a Nazi controlled world 102 years after World War II. He is hunted (literally) by a "Reichsforester" (a title Hermann Göring had during the Third Reich). He takes refuge with genetically mutilated "undesirables" — one of the first fictional descriptions of genetic manipulation.
