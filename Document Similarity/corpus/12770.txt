 In this album, a struggle between Longtarin and Lagaffe begins. This theme will also be the occasion of most of the gags in the next album. *parking meter: fake meter, so well imitated that drivers fill it *mini lawn ower: miniature lawn mower to avoid cutting daisies *heating for motorbikes: suit linked to the radiator of the motorbike, and in which heated water flows, so that the motorcyclist is never cold; the only problem is that it lacks a regulator *electricity generator: thanks to a dynamo, a treadle lights a small lamp and allows the staff to deal with very urgent work in case of power failure *inflatable bag: bag to protect car occupants in case of accident, it goes off even in case of slight contact
