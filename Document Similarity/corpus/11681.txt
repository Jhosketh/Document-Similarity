 In this sequel, the children have decided to play that they are Romany, and begin their usual practice of copious reading and reproduction of authentic practices. While April plunges in with enthusiasm, the more Melanie learns, the more something seems to be holding her back. Meanwhile, Toby Alvillar reveals that he actually has some Gypsy ancestry. He believes he can get some of his grandmother's things to use as props for the new game. However, the children never get around to playing the Gypsy Game. Toby becomes the subject of a custody dispute between his eccentric artist father and his wealthy, conservative grandparents. Under the extreme pressure, Toby runs away and begins a life on the street. Along the way, the kids discover some nasty historical facts about the Romany, not to mention the hard lives of the homeless people Toby meets. The story goes on to describe how the children locate Toby and decide to abandon their fantasy games, taking on real-world responsibilities.
