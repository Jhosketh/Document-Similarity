 Bernard Valcourt, a documentary filmmaker from Quebec, has been sent to the Rwandan capital Kigali to set up a television station. He falls in love with a Rwandan girl Gentille, who in reality is an ethnic Hutu, but she is often mistaken for a Tutsi. With the Hutu government is encouraging violence against Tutsis, Gentille's life becomes in danger. Encouraged by his love for Gentille, and a desire to complete a documentary to bring the tragedy of AIDS to the attention of the outside world, Valcourt refuses to leave Rwanda. When the two are married, they become tragically separated, leaving Valcourt believing that Gentille has, inevitably been killed. He then determines to document her life story, and sets out to discover the story of her final days.
