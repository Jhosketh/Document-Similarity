 It all begins when nine year old Sadie's mother, who is a childminder, gets ill. Sadie now has to look after all the children her mum is meant to look after, but eventually the other children's mothers take turns to look after all the children at their workplaces, i.e. at a police station, in an office and at a chocolate shop. The book is written through Sadie's perspective. It is a hilarious tale of how younger children are taken to work with their parents and explains all about child minders and their jobs. It is also an ebook.
