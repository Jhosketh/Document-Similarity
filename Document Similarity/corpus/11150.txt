 The story begins with Joan's early memories, and her first marriage. Her husband dies, and she marries Will Peirce. Together they make the decision to cross the sea and live in Jamestown, leaving Joan's daughter Cecily behind until she is old enough to earn the right to her own land. Joan and her younger daughter, Jane, are placed on a different ship than Will, where she meets Elizabeth, her highly irritable neighbor, and Maggie, a kind, cheerful woman. The ship sails through a hurricane, causing the ships to become separated. The ship eventually lands at Jamestown, where the settlers are already struggling. Maggie, Elizabeth, and Tempie share a house with Joan and Jane, and they work together to survive disease, starvation, and attack.
