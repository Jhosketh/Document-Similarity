 This novel is a story of cultural conflict between the Inuit of Northern Quebec and white men, set in the 1940s. It is told from the perspective of the main character Agaguk, an Inuit man. Agaguk diverges from his tribe with a woman named Iriook. Through their journeys, Yves Th√©riault explores Agaguk's mastery of nature as well as the general relationship between the Inuit and the tundra. Furthermore, by describing the conflicts with the white men, the themes of alcoholism, assimilation as well as economic and judicial injustice are thoroughly explored. The personal aspect of the novel also allows for an intriguing analysis of Agaguk and his behaviour towards his wife in particular.
