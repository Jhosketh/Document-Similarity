 The novel, set in the Great Depression, tells the story of how Vito Corleone rose through the criminal underworld to become the most powerful Don in New York. Vito pushes Sonny to be a businessman, but Sonny &mdash; 17 years old, impatient and reckless &mdash; wants something else: to follow in his father's footsteps and become a part of the real family business. It also shows the upbringing of Luca Brasi and how Tom Hagen became the Corleones' consigliere.
