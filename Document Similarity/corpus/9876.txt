 The novel talks about a traveller - we don’t know much about him - who goes to the village of Femés in Lanzarote; there he’s interested about an old woman, who walks in the shadows at night. She is María, who everybody calls Mararía. Woman, lover or witch, but a myth over all. His interest is fed by the stories that he can listen to the people who live in the village, in which everyone fell in her net in the past.Whenever she loved someone, their relationship ended badly, and everybody in the village thinks she is guilty for their suffering. Now she is an old woman who walks in the dark and endures barking dogs and people’s comments. She is a symbol of purification and self-destruction.
