 The wife of politician David Stratton is away in San Francisco, visiting relatives there. Stratton comes home one night but not to an empty house -- a young woman, Jody, is waiting inside. Jody tells him a tale of woe, so David offers to help. But the truth is, she has just busted out of a juvenile detention home, where she stabbed a matron and started a fire. And she is far from alone, because three young men suddenly materialize to torment David, who is afraid of a public scandal that could end his career. If he tries to get away and contact the cops, Jody threatens to accuse David of rape. The young men and Jody enjoy a wild party, but also begin to quarrel until one is cut with a razor. The body is dumped from a car. Jody and David end up hiding in a motel. But when the punks return, a chase occurs and their car crashes, killing all. Jody, too, ends up at death's door, but absolves David of any blame.
