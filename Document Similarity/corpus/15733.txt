 We meet the Henry family as they are driving from their small western Pennsylvania town to their new lives in Cape Hatteras. On the way, Jack accidentally starts an argument between his two parents because his father will tell lies just to win people over, while his mother will be honest no matter what. When they get to Cape Hatteras, a guard stops them because the island is covered with water. Jack's father lies their way onto the island. Everyone in the family is disappointed with their new home, which is a trailer half submerged in the water. Jack meets a new friend, Julian, who likes to stutter and play air guitar. Jack lies to Julian and tells him that he is from New York City and that his father is an admiral. After that, Jack realizes that he is more like his dad. Jack develops a crush on his new teacher, Miss Noelle. Miss Noelle learns about his crush when she keeps Jack after school for not writing a report about his dreams. Miss Noelle tells him that some of the best friendships start with a crush. Meanwhile, the principal of First Flight Elementary, Mrs. Nivlash, asks to see Jack. She tells him her plan to allow gum chewing at the school. However, if someone sticks just one piece of gum, the privilege will be revoked. Mrs. Nivlash appoints Jack to become the school's "respect detective" - someone to report if gum is being stuck to things. Jack hates his new duty as a respect detective, so he just tells Mrs. Nivlash all the good things kids have been doing, prompting her to stop being suspicious. Jack's father is feeling depressed, so the Henry family decides to throw him a big birthday party. Jack gets him a lucky Buddha statuette, which his father begins to believe in after it brings him a streak of good luck. One day, however, Jack's father accidentally casts the Buddha into the ocean, prompting him to realize that all along, he just got lucky.
