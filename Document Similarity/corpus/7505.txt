C. Dhameeja,who is also of some importance. The story is enriched with Feluda's extreme detection capability and another breathtaking adventure. On the way Feluda and the gang face many challenges, but at the end of the story Feluda gets much desired success, and the villain is trapped. Like many other Feluda stories, Jatayu brings the exquisite comic relief in the story and the story becomes enjoyable to everyone.
