 The moon rises and shines through a girl's bedroom window. It then shines on a silent street, corn and wheat fields and autumn trees. A young girl and her cat play a game by its light, a pilot flies a plane using its light. The moon sets in the daylight as the young girl and her cat say goodnight.
