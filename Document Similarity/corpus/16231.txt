 Get Rich Click! is a comprehensive source of information from one of the world's most successful Internet entrepreneurs. It differs from other "make money online" books by not offering a system or one specific path to riches. The author draws on his business background to explain the internet as a new medium for business. His research looked at the internet as a whole and attempts to distill the infinite internet business models into different internet industries. The book follows this research logically by devoting chapters to different internet industries (e-commerce, search, advertising, affiliate marketing, domain names, social media, and others). In addition to research, the book is interspersed with case studies from successful internet entrepreneurs in many of the aforementioned internet industries. In an effort to bridge the virtual and physical world, the majority of these case studies contain QR codes which take a reader to a video interview with the people featured in the case studies. Furthermore, each chapter contains Marc’s new ideas and thoughts on how to profit in any particular internet industry. Several themes are consistently presented through the book: "Learn More, Earn More"™ is seen throughout the book as a reference to the critical task of continuous learning in the internet’s ever changing landscape. "Know your strengths, hire your weaknesses" also appears throughout the book. In typical context it is urging the reader to focus on his/her core competencies while leveraging outsourced talents to handle the rest.
