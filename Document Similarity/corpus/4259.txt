 Lyric, a Melodie; is friend of Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila, must return to her homeworld of Yavin 8. She must go through a change to join the elders of her race. In the caves of Yavin 8 are carvings similar to those found near the Golden Globe. If Anakin and Tahiri can decipher the markings, they may be able to break the mysterious curse. Along the way, they must overcome a reel, defeat wraiths, and escape the purella, a giant spider-like monster that feeds on Melodies.
