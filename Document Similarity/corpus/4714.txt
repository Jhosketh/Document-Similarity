 The book questions the U.S. government version of the events and raises a large number of questions on the details of the events which, according to many observers, marked the beginning of the 21st century and changed the geopolitical world order. It makes the following claims: The actions that provoked the collapse of the Twin Towers in the heart of New York and damaged part of the Pentagon building were not the result of attempts by foreign suicide pilots, but were rather an action organized by a group within the U.S. administration; an internal plot aimed at driving opinion and forcing the course of events. The war on Afghanistan was not a response to the September 11 events, since it was prepared long before in coordination with the British. President Bush found support in evangelical groups to launch a crusade against Islam, according to the strategy known as “Clash of Civilizations”. The “war on terror” was a pretext to cut individual liberties in the United States and later in allied countries in order to impose a military regime. Osama bin Laden was a CIA fabrication and never stopped working for the U.S. secret service. The bin Laden and the Bush families jointly manage their wealth by means of the Carlyle Group. The U.S. administration was taken over by some industrial groups (weapons, oil, pharmaceuticals) whose interests would be defended by the government in detriment of others. The CIA would develop a program of interference at all levels, which would include the resource of torture and political assassination.
