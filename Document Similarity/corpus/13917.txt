 In the book Comm details the techniques that he used to raise the earnings generated by the AdSense units on his websites from $3 per day to more than $600 per day. Comm's system is based on the principle that ads blended into a Web page to look like content generate more clicks and hence more revenue than those that stand out. Comm stresses that good content is still vital to success but that good optimization – a combination of clever placement, keyword targeting and careful blending – can produce high income from advertisers. He also explains how to follow stats and test strategies to discover the best approach for each website.
