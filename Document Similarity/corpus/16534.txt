 The book follows several characters as they deal with an alien invasion on the microscopic level. The narration is primarily through the perspectives of Perry Dawson, an ex-football player with an anger problem, and Margaret Montoya, an epidemiologist with the CDC that is investigating a strange disease that turns seemingly normal people into murderers.
