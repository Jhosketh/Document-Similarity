 William Queen was a nearly 20-year ATF veteran as well as a motorcycle enthusiast when, in 1998, a “confidential informant” contacted Queen's superiors, offering to help place an agent inside the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols. Queen's work was soon to become the most extensive undercover operation into a motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement.
