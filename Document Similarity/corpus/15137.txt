Deogratias is at a bar and meets some old friends. Deogratias has flashbacks to his life before the genocide. He remembers the crush he had on the two girls and how he tried to spend time with them. In the flashbacks, Deogratias wasn't always a good person. We meet other people in the story. The two tribes in the country didn't get along. Deogratias was a bit caught in the middle of the feud. His life after the genocide seems very bad. In day three of Deogratias returns to the town looking for urwagwa (banana beer) because he is turning into a dog again, but doesn't.
