 This scenario involves wilderness adventures along the Orcs Head Peninsula on the Savage Coast. In the safe, seaside town of Slagovich, the player characters set anchor and stay at the inn, where they hear stories of Orcs Head Peninsula. Lost cities full of hidden treasures, terrible beasts and cannibals roaming the coast, gold ore piling up at the mouths of rivers, and a secretive religious sect. What would motivate the adventurers to enter the uncharted jungles of the Savage Coastâ€”curiosity, a desire to help others, or simple greed?
