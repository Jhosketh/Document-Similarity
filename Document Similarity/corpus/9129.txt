 Chinese rebel Fan Su turns up in San Francisco, asking for Nick Carter. She wants his help in setting up her Undertong, a rebel group seeking to overthrow the Chinese government. She reveals that her brother has reached a high post in the Red Guard. The CIA and AXE are not interested – they don’t see the Chinese government falling any time soon – but they do have a use for the organization. The Chinese are preparing to detonate an H-bomb near the Indian border – a bomb bigger than any built by the U.S. or Russia. The Chinese will then claim that they have an arsenal of such weapons, hoping to intimidate many third world nations. In exchange for a few million dollars worth of gold and equipment, Carter is to be transported to the bomb’s test site so that he can destroy it. Few things go right, but in the end, they reach the Valley of the Yeti. They destroy the bomb, but not before something kills Fan Su - possibly a yeti.
