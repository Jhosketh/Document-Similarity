 Mr Brainfright dresses in a banana mascot suit to support Northwest Southeast Central School, also getting extremely obsessed with bananas and boring the class - unusual for him! Mr Brainfright also teaches the class to visualise all the events in the Northwest Interschool Sports Event, while Mr Grunt, their sports teacher, tortures them cruelly and gives 50 laps around the oval as punishment to those who fail. Finally the event DOES come, and it is neck and neck between the two schools until Henry McThrottle has to replace Mr Brainfright in his banana suit, being scared of it because he used to mascot for the Banana Emporium, and caused a car crash into the Emporium. Fiona tells him it wasn't his fault - he wasn't in the official police report. However, Northwest West Academy's mascot, a real pit bull terrier, attacks Henry and he starts running in the decathlon in desperation, also being caught up by Chomp occasionally. They beat the speed record for all the events in the decathlon! One judge ruled that Chomp added weight to Henry during the pole vaulting sport, therefore, Northwest Southeast win by one point! This ruined West's winning streak. Mr Brainfright no longer has mascot madness, due to the absence of his banana-suit. Mr Grunt becomes the sports teacher for Northwest West Academy, ensuring that Northwest West Academy do not win next year with Mr Brainfright replacing his job. Fred and Clive, who told Mr Constrictor (NWW Academy's principal) about the banana-suit, do NOT get expelled. The story ends with the chapter, with Mr Brainfright's Guide to Banana Mascotting.
