 Official synopsis: :Stuart Hadley is a young radio-electronics salesman in early 1950s in a town south of San Francisco, California. Hadley is also an angry young man, an artist, a dreamer, and a screw-up. He has what many would consider an ideal life; a nice house, a pretty wife, a good job with prospects of advancement, but he still feels unfulfilled; something is missing from his life. From drinking to sex to religious fanaticism, Hadley unsuccessfully tries to fill his void. He reacts to his wife's love and kindness of his employer with anxiety and fear rather than acceptance. This is the story of Hadley's descent into depression and madness, and the story of his redemption.
