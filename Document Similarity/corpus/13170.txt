 A stranded ant is having trouble finding help because other animals refuse to help him. An elephant notices the ant and helps him. After that, the elephant helps more animals. The ant is the only animal that said thanks to the elephant. When the elephant has helped out everyone, he falls into a ravine and he can't get out. When he is ready to give up and die, a horde of ants carry him to safety.
