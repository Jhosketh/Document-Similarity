 The child killer &ndash; identified only as "Chappy" &ndash; who narrates most of the novel, has been in prison for 23 years. Now in his 50s and with a parole hearing approaching, he receives a letter from an unnamed 19-year-old girl who takes a morbid interest in his case. She then begins to relate how she plans on seducing a 12-year-old boy named Matthew who lives in her neighbourhood. The girl corresponds with him and the manâ€™s past is contrasted with explicit details of how she seduces Matthew, a typical young boy with many of the unattractive habits a 12-year-old can have, plus a few uniquely disgusting ones of his own creation. Chappy encourages her, and the girl soon accomplishes her mission by first giving Matthew tennis lessons and then, when she babysits him, strips naked and gives him a quick hands-on lesson in feminine biology. The pair soon have sex and continue to do so on regular occasions. Chappy eagerly reads the girl's letters as she describes her successes, although he also berates her for her poor grammar and for her liberal use of exclamation points. There are several scenes of prison sex. During the novel, Chappy makes frequent references to "Alice," his victim, but it is only towards the end of the book that he finally elaborates. Alice was a 12-year-old girl with whom he had a sexual relationship. At the very end of the story, during his parole hearing, we find out the convict brutally murdered and decapitated Alice after she blamed him for her bleeding, which was actually her period (she didn't know what it was). He tried to explain to her what had happened, but she kept threatening to kill him. The novel also references Chappy's childhood, especially his unstable, emotionally and sexually abusive mother.
