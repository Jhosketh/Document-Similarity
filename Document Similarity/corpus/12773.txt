 Le g√©ant de la gaffe is the first album in which Franquin inserts eccentric signatures. Monsieur De Mesmaeker is less present than in previous albums. *alcohol detector: device to mesure the rate of alcohol in the blood, it must not be exposed to fire *electric umbrella: umbrella that can open and close pushing on the same button *coffee-maker: personal invention that delivers very strong coffee *graft for cactus: graft which allow cactuses to grow extremely rapidly *spring-wire for phones: wire very elasticated, that may hurt dangerously the user *soap: soap that blows a lot of bubbles once it is in contact with water *automatic door: door that open automatically thanks to photoelectric cells *heating system: system for cars installed which conducts the gas by a chemney *spray for carburetor: an effective but polluting system *hand-armchair : very comfortable armchair designed as a giant hand *monorail: device linked to rails set in the ceiling to get around easily in the offices *monorail monoplace: the same monorail, modified -because being too low, it could hurt people- but with a default in the brake system
