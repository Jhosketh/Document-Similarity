 The narrator, a writer, prides himself on his astute review of Hugh Vereker's latest novel. Vereker dismisses his efforts, explaining that all critics have "missed my little point," "the particular thing I've written my books most for," "the thing for the critic to find," "my secret," "like a complex figure in a Persian carpet." The narrator racks his brains and, in desperation, tells his friend Corvick of the puzzle. Corvick and his novelist fiancée, Gwendolen, pursue "the trick" without success until Corvick, traveling alone in India, wires Gwendolen and the narrator "Eureka! Immense." He refuses, however, to divulge the secret to Gwendolen until after they are married, and then dies in an accident. Since Gwendolen refuses to share her knowledge, the narrator speculates, "the figure in the carpet [was] traceable or describable only for husbands and wives--for lovers supremely united." She remarries, and after her death, the narrator approaches her new husband to discover the secret. But he is surprised and humiliated by the news of his wife's great "secret," and he and the narrator conclude by sharing the same throbbing curiosity. The "secret" is ultimately never told but the reader can only infer it is in fact that there is no real secret. Vereker's description is that its very simple and Corvick holds the key but refuses to tell the narrator. Gwendolen assures the narrator that it is her life. Readers and commentators have speculated about the secret, but the brute fact is that James doesn't tell it, if, indeed, he actually had something specific in mind. Perhaps he—and Vereker—are simply teasing readers.
