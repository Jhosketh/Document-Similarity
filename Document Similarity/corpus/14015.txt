 The book centers around Alice Tully, a 16 year old waitress who is living in Croydon. She has a boyfriend called Frankie, and lives with a carer called Rosie. She killed her friend, Michelle, when she was 10 years old, as Jennifer Jones, and had been released from jail 6 months previously. The book follows certain parts of the story such as Alice now, Jennifer and the killing, and her new identity when the press expose her at the end of the book. There are four sections in the book: the first is in the mindset of Alice Tully, the second of Jennifer Jones (going into details of her childhood, showing her mother's descent into prostitution and the build up to the crime), the third of Alice Tully (as her identity is revealed) and the last of Kat Rickan (Jennifer's new identity).
