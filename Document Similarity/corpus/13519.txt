 The novel is set shortly after the events of The Third Option. CIA Director Thomas Stansfield has succumbed to his terminal cancer, leaving many in Washington confused as to why his dying wish was to have the Director of the Counter Terrorism Center Dr. Irene Kennedy to succeed him. Henry "Hank" Clark, the corrupt and ambitious Republican U.S. senator from the previous book, who treats everyone like pieces on a Chess board, still has his eyes on the Presidency. Fortunately for Clark almost all people, including Rapp, are not aware of his true self. President Xavier Hayes and Kennedy summon Mitch Rapp and ask him to assemble a team to infiltrate Saddam Husseinâ€™s nuclear weapons production facility.
