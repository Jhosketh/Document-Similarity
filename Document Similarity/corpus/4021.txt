 Neil begins his story with explaining the beginning of his travels by motorcycle from his home in Quebec to Telegraph Creek, British Columbia. In reality he has no schedule, no restriction in time, or life for that matter. In time he finds himself traveling from Canada to Alaska, and then ultimately down south through the United States to Mexico then to Belize. Eventually he travels (by plane) back to his home in Canada where he continues a series of letters to his friend Brutus. He then continues his journey, which ultimately ends at his home.
