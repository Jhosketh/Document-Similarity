 According to the publisher, in the book "Hannity offers a survey of the world &mdash; political, social, and cultural &mdash; as he sees it." The book has been described as "an unapologetic diatribe against liberalism, questioning its logic and posing questions about the outcome of its agenda for Americans". The book's publisher, ReganBooks, a division of HarperCollins, was owned by Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News.
