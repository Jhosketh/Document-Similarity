 Sir James Monmouth has travelled all his life. After the death of his parents he was raised by his guardian. Later he began to travel and in the story he arrives in England. He sees a young, pale ghostlike boy upon his arrival at the Cross Keys Inn. Strangely, he happens to see this ghost more often in the following months that he is in England. His goal is to gain as much information as possible about the great traveller Conrad Vane.
