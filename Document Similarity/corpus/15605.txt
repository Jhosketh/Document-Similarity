 Delia is an eighth grader in Cincinnati, Ohio. She competes on a team in the Double Dutch world championships with her friends Yolanda, Charlene, and her friend Randy is the waterboy. During school they are told they might have to pass a standardized test in order to be on the team, which is ghastly news for Delia because she can’t read. Randy is also having difficulties. His dad is a truck driver, so Randy is often left home alone to care for himself. Randy’s dad has been gone for weeks, and still hasn’t called. Soon Randy has to sell the VCR and other appliances to pay the rent and buy food. Later Randy tells the coach and goes to stay with his family for awhile. Everyone is trying to avoid the Tolliver twins, because of the rumors surrounding them. It is said in the book that they kill puppies for fun, and terrorize their mother. During the story two tornadoes hit the school while it's in session. Yolanda goes to the bathroom shortly before they hit, and remains missing for a while after. Also right before the tornadoes hit the Tolliver twins run out of the classroom. They later rescue Yolanda and we find out they are not only scared of storms, but they both like Yolanda. After this they become friends. After an exciting competition, Delia sees a paper with a picture of Randy’s dad on it, but because she can’t read, she doesn’t tell Randy because she thinks he knows. Randy, however, sees it while cleaning up and finds out that Delia saw it too. They fight for a bit, and Randy tells Delia his secret. She feels guilty for not telling him, so she tells Randy that she can’t read and runs out of the gym. Later she goes to dinner with her mother, and reveals to her secret to her as well. Also, we find out that Randy's dad was robbed while on his route and was just recently discovered.
