 For a considerable portion of the story Elijah is very compliant, obeying everything God's angels say. Eventually he realizes that his destiny is not being chosen by him but by God and ultimately, he decides to abide by his own desires and will. In this way Coelho suggests that Elijah was able to reach an ultimate level of spiritual awareness and have the most powerful relationship with God. ar:الجبل الخامس cs:Pátá hora de:Der fünfte Berg es:La quinta montaña fr:La Cinquième Montagne it:Monte Cinque ka:მეხუთე მთა ne:द फिफ्थ् माउन्टेन pl:Piąta Góra pt:O Monte Cinco ru:Пятая гора tr:Beşinci Dağ
