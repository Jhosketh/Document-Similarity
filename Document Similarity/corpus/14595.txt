 Olivia's parents are separated. Her father has a mistress, Rosalie, with who he lives now. Olivia's mother is upset because of it, but she doesn't want her husband to come back. At school, Olivia has a problem, because she was chosen to organise a school theatre. She doesn't like the idea and she tells the headmaster that she won't face the challenge. The same thing does Luke - Poppy's boyfriend. Once, Hayley, Livi's friend, invites her to the Stomping Ground night club. Before this, she goes to a dinner with her father and Rosalie. Livi changes her opinion about Rosalie, because she realises that she can have problems, too (Rosalie's mother makes problems, because she's got Alzheimer's disease). Once, while coming back from school, Olivia meets Ryan - a handsome boy, who lives with his mother on a boat in summer. She meets him at Stomping Ground, where they dance together. Livi starts to fall in love with him. But she can't invite him to come to her house, because her mother gets a new person to live with them - Leonora. Olivia doesn't like her, but few weeks later, Ryan tells her that Leo is his aunt. Some time later, Ryan invites his mother to go with him to Olivia's. Livi finds out that, Ryan is her elder brother. She's disappointed, but she falls in love with another boy from her school. Livi's parents are going to get divorced.
