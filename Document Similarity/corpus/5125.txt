 George, 6th Viscount Uffenham, a typically impecunious and absent-minded Wodehousian aristocrat, mislays his Aunt's fortune in diamonds, and is forced to let his family pile, returning there disguised as a butler named Cakebread to seek the gems. The story also features the crooks Alexander "Chimp" Twist and "Dolly" and "Soapy" Molloy, who had earlier appeared in Sam the Sudden (1925) and Money for Nothing (1928).
