 It all starts when the two find an old document in a secret compartment in their father's desk. Strangely enough, the document seems familiar to Sarah. After much thinking, she realizes she has seen a name on it from the Peter and the Starcatchers series. The document is much older than the books, and of course the books are just stories... Right? Wrong. Soon, the two Cooper children become entangled in an adventure straight out of the pages of the book!
