 The protagonists of Kirakira, Shikanosuke, Kirari, Sarina and Chie are the members of the at the Christian school Ohbi Gakuen. The club was set to be closed in next March so they try to set up a band they call the to save the club. Their performance at the subsequent school festival succeeds with flying colors. That performance was put on the Internet where one of the live houses in Nagoya offered the band to put on a performance in Nagoya. They honestly want to disband after the performance at the school festival because they had to study for entrance exams or look for jobs, but they were convinced to go on a live tour by Yagihara, the vocalist of Star Generation. Shikanosuke's band d2b begins its live tour across Japan in an old van.
