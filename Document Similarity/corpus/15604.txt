 Waylander is a rich lord, living in a distant land, away from his problems in Drenan. At the same time, an ancient evil is trying to penetrate our world by a magical portal. Legendary cursed creatures are back to conquer the world that once belonged to them, in blood and terror. Only a handful of heroes remain, with a mysterious man leading them: a man with his hands covered with blood, who killed for money. A man known, in the Drena√Ø world, as an assassin. To vanquish evil, a riddle must be solved, and Waylander must kill a man who cannot be killed.
