 The story takes place in a world somewhat reminiscent of Medieval period Europe. In this world, there are many Gods that get their power from the people that worship them. However, the Gods are forbidden from directly tampering with the human world. The more powerful Gods, in this case, the God of Light, grant certain humans some of their power in order to act out their will. The God of Light has twelve Knights to do so, led by the Sun Knight. With his enchanting blue eyes, shining golden hair and dazzling smile, he is the epitome of perfectionâ€”the perfect representative of justice and compassion. But in truth, the Sun Knight's true self is a cynical, sarcastic man who would rather be anything else than the overbearing Sun Knight who has to speak of the Light God in all his waking hours.
