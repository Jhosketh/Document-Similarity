 In the Introduction, Armstrong presents two forms of knowledge, mythos and logos. Since the 16th and 17th century, she says logos governed civilization, resulting in two phenomena: fundamentalism and atheism. Armstrong says that the "new" atheists have made some valid criticisms of religion but that they focused on fundamentalism. She says they "aren't radical enough" and finds their work "disappointingly shallow". Her study of religion during the prior twenty years gave her this book and something fresh to [bring to] the table".
