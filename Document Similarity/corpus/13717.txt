 Detective Inspector Ray Lennox is recovering from a mental breakdown induced by stress and taking drugs, and a child murder case back home in Edinburgh. On vacation in Florida his fianc√©e, Trudi, is only interested in planning their wedding and, after an argument, abandons Lennox in a bar. He meets two women in a bar and goes back to their place to have a cocaine binge, but they are interrupted by two strangers. After a fight Lennox is left in the apartment with Tianna, the 10-year-old daughter of one of the women. Lennox takes her across the state to an exclusive marina where he walks right into a hornets' nest of paeodophiles, just like the one that had haunted him on a similar case in Edinburgh. Now he must protect the girl from them at all costs.
