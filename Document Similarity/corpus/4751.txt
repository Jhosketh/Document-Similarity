 This adventure takes place in modern France and uses the normal continuing storyline of the series. It describes the holidays of Lapinot (a.k.a. McConey) and his friends Richard, Titi, and Pierrot in a winter sports resort. This volume is mostly a collection of unrelated episodes, although there are a few recurring links such as the much talked about but never seen wolf (except for an ambiguous fog shape) which reportedly killed skiers in the area. The dialogue is sometimes philosophical, sometimes silly. This is the album where Lapinot first meets Nadia, who would later on become his girlfriend, although she only plays a minor part here.
