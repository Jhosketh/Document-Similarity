 The novel centres around James Hyde and his family. A former Royal Navy quartermaster, in 1837 Hyde sets up a business in early Sydney. He brings his family to Australia and would have his sons and grandsons continue his business. They are either disinclined to take up the business or more interested in the Australian gold-fields. His daughter Fanny has all the qualities needed to continue the family business. Constricted by gender stereotypes, Hyde, his business, and his family fall into tragedy.
