 Some of the developments mentioned include: * Implementation of fusion power. * Genetic engineering, including Life Extension and Transhumanism as some humans become engineered to live in extreme environments such as cold, zero-g, and even water-breathing humans for aquatic communities. * Geopolitical events such as war, famine, pestilence, and terrorism (as well as the "Sinking of Japan" by an earthquake). * Bioengineered foods including whimiscal items such as the Jack Spratt Grass Chop, photosynthetic suits grafted to human skin meant to provide a means of sustinance without eating. * Self-driving automobiles (the "Tiger-Dream Machine" from Ford Autocar). * L5 (Lagrange Point) space colonies such as those proposed by Scientist Gerard K. O'Neill. * Asteroid mining (such as the "Cracking of Ceres"). * Artificial Intelligence. * Extreme cosmetic Body Modification such as skin with pockets, flashing irises, fur, claws, and fingernails which function as timepieces. * Sublight starships such as the Bussard Ramjet. * Terraforming. * Interstellar colonization, and eventual extraterrestrial contact. As this book was written in the 1980s, some predictions for the near future were off - for example, the Soviet Union was predicted to exist as late as the year 2800.
