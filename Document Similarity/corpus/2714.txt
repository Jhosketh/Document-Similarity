 Thirty-two-year-old narrator Kensuke Yazaki takes a nostalgic look at the year 1969 when he, as an ambitious and aspiring seventeen-year-old, living in Sasebo, in western Kyushu where he gets into antics with his equally ambitious and enthusiastic best friends, Iwase and Adama. Their priorities are girls, cinema, music, literature, pop culture, organising a school festival "The Morning Erection Festival", bettering teachers and enemies, and finding a way to change the world somehow.
