 Following the attack on the Chinese city of Shanghai by the Japanese forces in August 1937, just before the outbreak of World War II, and during the subsequent occupation of the Yangtze River Delta in China by Japan, despite the violence of the assault, many of the Chinese elite came forward to collaborate with the occupying forces, mirroring collaboration with the Nazis in the occupied countries of Europe. Brook analyzes both Chinese and Japanese archives in order to build up a picture of the collaboration, which extended from Shanghi to Nanjing. He argues that "collaboration proved to be politically unstable and morally awkward for both sides, provoking tensions that undercut the authority of the occupation state and undermined Japan's long-term prospects for occupying China."
