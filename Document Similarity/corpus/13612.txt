 As the title suggests, the story concerns the life of Firmian Stanislaus Siebenkäs, and is told in a comedic style. Unhappily married, Siebenkäs goes to consult his friend Leibgeber, who is in reality his alter ego, or Doppelgänger (a word of Jean Paul's own invention). Leibgeber convinces Siebenkäs to fake his own death, in order to begin a new life. Siebenkäs takes the advice of his alter ego, and soon meets the beautiful Natalie. The two fall in love; hence the "wedding after death," as found in the title.
