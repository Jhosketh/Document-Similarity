 Toby's adventures continue as he heads back to the tree to save his parents, Elisha (who is held captive by Leo Blue) and all the Grass People who are being held captive by the evil Joe Mitch, who is digging a hole to the center of the tree, determined to get the secret knowledge of how the tree lives from Toby's father. Meanwhile Toby meets up with another one of his old friends, Nils Amen, who is the leader of a band of woodcutters and is also helping to hide some fugitives in a secret forest in the tree. Nils pretends to side with Leo Blue, in order to give Elisha the message that Toby has returned.
