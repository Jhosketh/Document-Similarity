 Angels and demons are forbidden to interfere in the physical plane, limited only to advise humans. When several demons attack angel Thal, this has the body of a man violating the rule mentioned. Then begins the battle between the Angels and demons, where God and the Devil are mere spectators. pt:O Senhor da Chuva
