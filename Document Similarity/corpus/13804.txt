 Three years after the events of the first book, a funeral is finally carried out for Conrad's missing father, Griffin Yeats, & there is an internal uproar over the symbols chosen for Griffin's headstone (the choices made by Griffin himself) & while trying to figure out what the symbols mean, Conrad stumbles into a race to find a missing artifact that contains Atlantean information buried somewhere under Washington DC- but before he can get far, an ancient terrorist organization known as the Alignment, who have secretly infiltrated the ranks of every government, religious organization & secret society on the planet, send an assassin after him, sparking a murder investigation, which is twisted into an attempt to assassinate the president- Now Conrad must avoid his own government & discover the globe, with or without Serena's help, before the Alignment can launch a global pandemic which will be set loose on the Fourth of July & wipe out almost all of humanity- allowing the Alignment to rise to power... and, he only has one week to accomplish all this!
