 The book concerns bus-driving, Magnus Mills himself was once a bus-driver in London. The title refers to the concept (upheld by the inspectors) that "a fixed interval between buses on a regular service can be attained and adhered to". The novel concerns the tension between the officious inspectors and the drivers themselves who aim to arrive early.
