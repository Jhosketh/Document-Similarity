 Libby Day, the novel's narrator and protagonist, is the sole survivor of a massacre in Kinnakee, Kansas, a fictional rural town. After witnessing the murder of her sister and mothers in what appears to be a Satanic cult ritual, she escapes through a window and later testifies in court against her teenaged brother. Twenty-five years after the massacre, Libby meets with a group of amateur investigators who believe that her brother in innocent of the crime. With the group's support, she begins an investigation of the events of the massacre, tracking down other witnesses and possible suspects. Interspersed with the modern day investigation are flashbacks to the day of the massacre. These flashbacks are told from the points of view of Libby's mother, Patty, and her brother, respectively. These viewpoints paint a picture of a grim life of desperate poverty, marital abuse and abandonment that characterize life on the farm prior to the murder. <!--
