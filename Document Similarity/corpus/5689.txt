 As the crew of the space station Oberon search for their missing pilot Captain Leo Davidson, a time dilation storm pulls the station into its heart forcing the Oberon to crashland on an alien planet. With most of the crew dead, the marooned survivors embark on a controversial genetics program to reengineer the various apes that survived the crash, into a strong-subservient and intelligent labor force to help them create a new colony. However, beneath the surface of the world, there exists a new threat. Now the survivors must transform the primates into a genetically enhanced Army to help defend them, before their greatly reduced technological resources are depleted.
