 This is regarded as one of the more plot driven novels in the series-with more emphasis on the story. Erika wants to write a 'great-book' so Patrik goes on paternity leave to look after the baby whilst this occurs; then unexplained things start to happen: an elderly neighbour is found dead â€“ not just that, but he has been dead for some time. What's more, this guy knew Erika's late mother. Erica consults a local historian of World War 2, however, shortly after her visit, he is brutally murdered and it becomes clear that the past is still very much a part of some people's lives. The plot focuses on the discovery of a child's blood spattered vest plus other memorabilia. Who would murder so cold-bloodedly to bury secrets so ancient? By way of a side-theme Melberg adopts a stray mutt finding that this leads to a meeting with another pooch owner who happens to be the mater of his new detective, Paul Morales; this provides a counterpoint to the increasingly sordid facts being unearthed in the search for the murderer.
