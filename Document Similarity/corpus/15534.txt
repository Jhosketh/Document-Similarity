 Blending steampunk with urban fantasy, Heartless is set in an alternate history version of Victorian England where vampires and werewolves are welcomed as members of society, often in the upper class. The protagonist of the novel is Alexia Tarabotti, the Lady Maccon, who is "soulless", and thus unaffected by the powers of supernatural beings. The author has stated in interviews that while Changeless and Blameless, the second and third books in the series, were closely linked, Heartless will be more independent, in the manner of Soulless, the series' first entry. *2011, USA, Orbit Books ISBN 0-316-12719-1, Pub date 28 June 2011, Paperback *2011, UK, Orbit Books ISBN 0-356-50009-8, Pub date 7 July 2011, Paperback On September 22, 2010, the author reported that the manuscript was "99% complete" and that the final draft of the novel was due to the publisher on November 1, 2010.
