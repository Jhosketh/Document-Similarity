 Aria Montgomery tries to keep her father Byron's affair a secret from her mother and brother, while Hanna deals with her social downturn by resuming her bulimia. Emily Fields is in a secret romantic relationship with Maya. Spencer Hastings remembers pushing Ali back on a stone path after a heated argument, and fears that she is the one who killed her. After Aria ignores "A's" threats, "A" tells her father Byron's affair to Ella, who kicks Aria out of the house. "A" also reveals Emily and Maya's relationship publicly, and Emily's parents force her into a program to "cure" her apparent homosexuality. Aria is also cheating on her boyfriend, Sean, with her AP English teacher, Ezra; "A" sends pictures of them kissing to Aria's boyfriend, who calls the police. Hanna is humiliated at Mona's 17th birthday party, and later receives a text from "A". This time, the number is not a jumbled mess, and Hanna recognizes it: she knows who "A" is. She calls Spencer, Emily, and Aria to meet her at their special spot, the Rosewood school playground; before she can tell them what she knows, Hanna is hit by a SUV. The story ends with Spencer, Emily, and Aria receiving a text saying, "She knew too much -A".
