 The novel follows the ongoing adventures of the three protagonists of The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters and is set in what appears to be an alternative Victorian past in a series of alternative Baltic or Teutonic states. The story began as a sequel to Dahlquist's earlier, complex fantasy novel, but eventually develops into a much larger work.
