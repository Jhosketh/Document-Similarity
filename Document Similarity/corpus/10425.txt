 The book mostly deals with Fergus's attempts to kill Damon, who tracks Damon all over the Mortal Kingdoms. When Marcel puts a curse over Elster to prove that Fergus would never kill the king, the curse backfires on Fergus, putting him in mortal danger, and Marcel journeys to Noam to try and undo the curse.
