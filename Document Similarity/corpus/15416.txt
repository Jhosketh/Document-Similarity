 In A Happy, Healthy You five professional women – a clinical nutritionist and internist, an oncologist, a psychologist, an exercise physiologist, and an attorney and certified life coach – collectively have authored a new book that offers a definitive guide to help empower women during the aging process, combat disease and improve overall health and well-being. Written in five parts, each of the authors shares her knowledge and experience in helping women embrace hope, spiritual guidance and the promise of rewarding relationships in every stage of life.
