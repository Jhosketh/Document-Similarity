 The twelve stories in Valentines are linked by the months of the year. Each brisk story captures the most candid moments between spouses, family members, and loversâ€”moments when dangerous feelings surge to the surface and everything changes. A wife realizes her closest confidante is much more than that. A father tries to dress his new lover in the clothing of his late wife. A woman, watching her son and husband from afar, sees something she can never forget.
