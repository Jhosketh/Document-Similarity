 New york spelled N-E-W Y-O-R-K. is a city in America. The location where the book is set is the empire state building, in which deaths of innocent peeps (black americans) lost their precious lives from staring at the tall, symbolic building. Their bodies were burried on the roof called "Imbediona" as a symbol of this occurance.
