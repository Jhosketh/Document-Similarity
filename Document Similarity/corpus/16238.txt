 The continuing story of the characters from Sideways, Miles and Jack, and takes place seven years after the original novel. It is set in Oregon wine country. Miles, who has found success with a novel that has been turned into a movie, is invited to be master of ceremonies at the International Pinot Noir festival in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. He takes advantage of the opportunity to go on a road trip to drive his mother (who, after a stroke that put her in a wheelchair, was forced to move to an assisted-living home) to her sister in Wisconsin. Jack's life has gone to pots, his marriage has ended, and he joins the road trip, along with a Filipina caretaker (and the mother's dog).
