 It is summer in Lake Eden, Minnesota and everyone is very excited with the family reunion that Hannah's partner Lisa has prepared coming up shortly. Lisa's Uncle Gus has made an unexpected return after a 30 year absence with expensive jewelry, clothes and a new car. Uncle Gus is immediately the center of attention at the reunion with no doubt. It is up to Hannah Swensen, the owner of The Cookie Jar bakery, to provide the treats. Hannah bakes one of her specialties, her carrot cake which is a big hit. Gus is impressed with Hannah's cake and asks her for another platter, but the next day as the pictures for the family reunion are being taken, everyone notices that there is one person missing. As Hannah goes out to search for Gus, she finds him over by the bar at the pavilion with two pieces of Hannah's carrot cake by his side, dead stabbed with an ice pick! It is up to Hannah to solve the mystery of the murder. It seems like Grandpa Jack might be blamed for killing Gus because of his Alzheimer's. Hannah thinks that he is not responsible for the murder, so she tries to prove that he is innocent. The book also has recipes.
