 Eight-hundred Chinese soldiers are found dead on the Chinese-Pakistan border. No wounds, no clues, no signs of battle. An American doctor working in Venezuela discovers an entire village dead without apparent cause. Concerned about a new weapon system of mass destruction, the American Secretary of State turns to Nobel Laureate physicist, Noah Schwartz. Autopsies are forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and then to Schwartz. Tapping his world-renowned contacts, Schwartz finds a theory that was to be released at a famous scientific conference but then inexplicably withdrawn. One of the two referees is dead while the other directs a secret research laboratory in Algeria. Other powers learn of the laboratory and move against it. As China and Pakistan edge towards war, Noah Schwartz races to grasp the secret technology and avert nuclear disaster.
