 The book covers a history of the seduction as well as the psychology that makes the described techniques supposedly effective. Greene claims to have studied notable figures such as Casanova, Cleopatra, and John F. Kennedy to create his guide. The book offers amoral advice on effective seduction, including "choose the right victim", and "approach indirectly". Greene also classifies several seduction archetypes, such as "the Siren", "the Charmer", and "the Natural".
