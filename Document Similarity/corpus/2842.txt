 The scenario is a three part adventure which involves a wilderness trek, a battle against brigands, and a venture into the tomb of a lizard king. Brigands have been wreaking havoc on the southern trade routes, while merchants have been demanding that the Count of Eor puts an end to the attacks. The Count is seeking brave adventurers to end the evil brigands' activities and discover the power behind the attacks. A short wilderness adventure follows the opening, and leads the characters to the tomb of the lizard king.
