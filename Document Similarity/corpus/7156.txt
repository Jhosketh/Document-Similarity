 Rejuvenile is about adults who behave and think in childlike and childish ways, and Noxon's opinion is that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. According to the book, many rejuveniles have found ways to lead productive and responsible lives without tossing aside things they've always loved -- from Necco Wafers to Tintin to skateboarding. The book is also a collection of stories of like-minded adults who do things like play dodgeball on the weekends, go to Walt Disney World Resort (without kids) and collect toys.
