 In Crown of Ancient Glory, the player characters must find the heir to the kingdom of Vestland and retrieve the magical Sonora Crown to unite the country before the Ethengar Khanate invades. The module includes plans for a longship. The player characters assist the kingdom of Vestland, whose High King has recently died. They must also recover the missing holy Sonora Crown, which is also a powerful artifact. The heir to the kingdom was lost at birth, and the players must determind the identity and location of the lawful heir of Vestland. The characters must deal with traitors and spies from within, and invadors from the forces of the Ethengar Khanate, massing on the borders to take advantage of Vestland's plight.
