 This novel predominantly follows Luce, full name Lucinda Price. She is a 17 year old girl who is reincarnated over and over again for an indeterminate number of lifetimes. As she reaches her seventeenth year she meets her angel boyfriend, Daniel, in each life time and is engulfed by flames. This is usually the result of kissing Daniel, but not always. Luce dies as a result of her encounters with Daniel and is reincarnated to repeat the cycle. The lifetime focused on in the Fallen series is unusual. Luce has kissed the very hot Daniel and survived it. Also, Luce was not baptized in this timeline which makes her unclaimed by any religion. This is alleged to mean this time when Luce dies, it will be forever. She has also discovered that Daniel is a fallen angel and he is to be a deciding force in the final battle between good and evil. Luce wants to get rid of the curse and Daniel chases her through history. Little does Daniel know, the future could change differently not because of Luce, but because of a certain person who will try helping Luce travel into her different past lives. Daniel and his other fallen angel friends and nephilim friends will try to catch up with her and bring her back to the present. As Luce travels through time, she will realize not only how much Daniel loves her, and how much she misses to being in his arms, but she will also be in danger from the one who is trying to help her.

The Fallen Angels are quite common in stories of conflict between good and evil. * Nephilim They are the children of fallen angels with mortals. * Outcast A particular rank of angels. Cam describes them as the worst kind of angel. They stood next to Satan during the "revolt", but did not step into the underworld with him. Once the battle ended, they tried to return to heaven, but it was too late. He also mentions that when they tried to go to hell, Satan cast out permanently, and left them blind. Nevertheless, the outcasts have a tremendous control of the other four senses. In "torment", they chased Luce because they think that if they captured her, they will get back to heaven. * Elders It is not explained very well what the elders are, but they want to see Luce dead more than anything. Miss Sophia is the eldest and most important member. * Scale Resident guide within the "Announcers" (also known as the "Shadows").
