 In Queen's Harvest, the player characters must enter a dead wizard's lair to obtain the perilous objects he left behind. The characters become embroiled in royal politics as adventure progresses. The first half of the adventure presents a basic dungeon, while the second half offers an extended siege of an enemy stronghold where the player characters are greatly outnumbered and outgunned; they must patiently whittle away at the opponents, then withdraw to regroup and heal. The wizard Kavorquian is dead, but certain items belonging to his adopted son were in the wizard's keeping at the time of his demise. The player characters must venture into the silent vaults of Kavorquian's stronghold and recover the missing property. The story ultimately leads the player characters into the nether reaches of Penhaligon's politics to confront Ilyana Penhaligon, the mad pretender to the throne.
