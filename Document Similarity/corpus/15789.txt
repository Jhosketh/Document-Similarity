 Forbidden takes place four-hundred eighty years after an unknown brush with extinction. Perfect order reigns, and the world is at peace. No more disease or famine. But then one day a man discovers the truth: every single soul on earth is actually dead. The human heart has been stripped of all that makes it human. Now only he is alive and only he has the knowledge that can once again awaken humanity. But the way is treacherous and the cost is staggering. For, indeed, in that day life itself is . . . forbidden.
