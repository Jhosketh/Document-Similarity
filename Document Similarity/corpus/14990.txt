 Ganesh and Vasanth visit a town for legal purpose involving settling down property inheritance issue. They meet a man KumaraVyasan, guardian of an innocent, amateur girl heir named Leena. According to the will the property cannot be divided, sold and it can be inherited only by the direct heirs at their eighteen years of age while close relatives are supposed to be guardians. While discussing, Ganesh and Vasanth are told that the legal heir girl has committed a murder by becoming a blood sucking vampire and he has concealed the victim's body by burying it two years ago. They were also told that there is a belief at the town that, a spirit which occurs once in two years will kill people. Ganesh not willing to accept that fact, searches for a valid explanation. He along with Vasanth visits the farm at night where they see an illusion in grey color resembling the girl Leena and some voices pointing to some names. Also many mysterious things happen at the farm house which terrorise both of them. Ganesh wanted to believe that there is no ghost but circumstanaces make him to slowly believe while Vasanth started to believe the fact of Spirit. KumaraVyasan was sure that Leena commits murders by the influence of spirit. Ganesh doubts Kumaravyasan that the incident are tricks mastered by him to eliminate Leena with motivations that he can be the heir if in case Leena dies without having children. Many murders occur during the course of investigation where Kumaravyasan is also one among victim.Circumstances point Leena to be killer but her innocence confuses Ganesh. Meanwhile all assumptions of science are collapsed and Ganesh starts to believe that the real explanation of all the incidents is the Spirit. What happens then? Does the spirit kills by taking revenge? Is spirit real or an illusion? Subsequent part of the story moves with the answers to these questions.
