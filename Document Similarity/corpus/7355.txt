Having endured great cruelty towards himself and his mother, he finally escapes with his beloved, a girl named Hatche.

Hatche was then imprisoned and later dies. Her mother, when Memed returns to the town, tells him he has a "women's heart" if he surrenders himself.

He finds Agha in the south-east corner of his house and shoots him in the breast.The local authorities hear the gun shots but Memed gets away barely before they are able to take a few shots at him.
