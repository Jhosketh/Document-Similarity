 The book includes Mitford's letters between 1924 leading up to her death in 1996. It chronicles her escape from family life and elopement with Esmond Romilly. Following Romilly's premature death, the letters document her subsequent marriage to Robert Treuhaft and her activism in the Civil rights movement, the American Communist Party and her expos√©s of the American funeral industry. As with her previous biography, Hons and Rebels, the letters also concentrate on her relationship with her relations, including her sisters and friends in America and England.
