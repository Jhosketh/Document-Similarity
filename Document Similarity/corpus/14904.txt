 : Relevant to today’s war-torn world, The Palace of Illusions takes us back to the time of the Indian epic The Mahabharat—a time that is half-history, half-myth, and wholly magical. Through her narrator Panchaali, the wife of the legendary five Pandavas brothers, Divakaruni gives us a rare feminist interpretation of an epic story. : The novel traces Panchaali’s life, beginning with her magical birth in fire as the daughter of a king before following her spirited balancing act as a woman with five husbands who have been cheated out of their father’s kingdom. Panchaali is swept into their quest to reclaim their birthright, remaining at the brothers’ sides through years of exile and a terrible civil war. Meanwhile, we never lose sight of her stratagems to take over control of her household from her mother-in-law, her complicated friendship with the enigmatic Krishna, or her secret attraction to the mysterious man who is her husband’s most dangerous enemy. Panchaali is a fiery female voice in a world of warriors, gods, and ever-manipulating hands of fate.Love can touch the human heart at any moment of time it happens to some and all.Draupadi was even made of flesh and bones with a human heart which experienced this feeling for Arjuna. Mere a toy in the ruthless handS of fate she had to accept four husbands and perform her duties dutifully.A tale of vision,submission, patience,sacrifice,pleasure, sorrows and punishment,the novel is a journey of a woman...someway or other which is a journey of each and every woman of modern times.It is a reflection of feminine beauty, glory and strength.
