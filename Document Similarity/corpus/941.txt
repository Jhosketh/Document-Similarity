 "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote" is written in the form of a review or literary critical piece about Pierre Menard, a (purely fictional) 20th century French writer. It begins with a brief introduction and a listing of all of Menard's work. Borges' "review" describes Menard's efforts to go beyond a mere "translation" of Don Quixote by immersing himself so thoroughly in the work as to be able to actually "re-create" it, line for line, in the original 17th century Spanish. Thus, Pierre Menard is often used to raise questions and discussion about the nature of authorship, appropriation and interpretation.
