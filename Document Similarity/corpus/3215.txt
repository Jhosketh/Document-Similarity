 In a small town in 1980s southern Japan, Sakutaro "Saku" Matsumoto and Aki Hirose, classmates all through junior high, become high school students and then fall in love. They share audio diaries, go on excursions together, and enjoy summer vacation. However, Aki finds herself suffering from Leukemia and begins to weaken, rendering her unable to see Saku or go outside. Saku is desperate to take her to Uluru (Ayers Rock) in Australia (the "Center of the World"), a place she had wished to visit. Saku buys tickets, but Aki dies before boarding the plane. Seventeen years later, an older, sombre Saku trudges through everyday existence. The last tape of Aki's audio diary is suddenly unearthed, leading Saku back to his hometown in the south, and back to his memories of their last days together.
