 Deep in the forest behind Full Moon City, an evil man named the Baron is trying to steal a magical object from the city of Atlantia called the Atlantia Talisman. Elsewhere, two boys named David Rush and Speedy Rush are trying to find it to save the world. They get help from the mermaid-like Mer sisters (Shilly, Damu, and Kijin), the faun named Dimvir, and the good ghoul named Finny, and they face monsters like werewolves and vampires and zombies.
