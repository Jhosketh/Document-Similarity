 In Medieval England, a daydreaming peasant named Steffin wants to pursue his imaginary quest, but he feels trapped by society. When an eccentric storyteller insists that Steffin's quest is real, Steffin is forced to take his destiny into his own hands and seek out his arch nemesis, the dark Lord of Boredom. Through a reckless chain of Don-Quixote-like adventures, colorful friends catch Steffin's dream, and the powers that oppose them begin to unveil themselves. But when reality kicks in and his friends have had enough, will Steffin be able to pull them back together and complete their quest, or will Lord Bore succeed in quelling the greatest of all adventures?
