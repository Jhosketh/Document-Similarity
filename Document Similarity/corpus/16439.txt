 In April 1974 there is a disappearance of a family without a trace from the island Valö just outside Fjällbacka: an Easter buffet is in the dining room and a baby (Ebba) is missing. Ebba is eventually found; then when older visits again the ancients children colony where her father ran a boarding school with an iron rule. Two parallel stories, one past/one present, where the past explains the present. Ebba and her husband Martin have lost a son, and in an attempt to overcome the sadness they decide to open a bed and breakfast.
