 Mass Effect: Retribution follows soon after the events of Mass Effect 2 . The Illusive Man, leader of the pro-human paramilitary organization Cerberus, is attempting to learn more about the Reapers, an advanced race of sentient machines that periodically purges the galaxy of all technologically advanced organic civilizations. Having obtained Reaper technology, the Illusive Man decides to implant a human with it to learn more about the Reapers. Paul Grayson, a major character in Mass Effect: Ascension and former Cerberus operative, is kidnapped to become the Illusive Man's test subject. Also, as said on the back cover of the book under the synopsis, David Anderson (one of the protagonists of Mass Effect Revelation and a supporting character in the first Mass Effect game) is again a main character, along with Kahlee Sanders from the 1st and 2nd books.
