The lives of the villagers of Pentre Bach are dominated by the whims of the colliery manager who doubles as the chapel minister and contributes to the hardship of the community by abusing his position to pursue his sexual aspirations. Rhys Morgan is haunted by the death of his sister Moira who died when he was sixteen and because of his self reproach he refuses to discuss it. For the love of his wife Nerys he sets aside many of his idealistic principles, and tries to concentrate on doing the best for his family.
