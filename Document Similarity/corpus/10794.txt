She loves to dance and sing. She even gets the lead role in a play. When orphaned Flora and Ruby move in with their grandmother Min (their legal guardian), which is a nickname given to her by Flora because when Flora was young whenever she asked for something Min always said “in a minute”. Her real name is Mindy Read. Their parents died in a car accident on a frosty January evening. Flora's father had said that they could go out for pizza but Flora wanted to finish her homework. But anyway Flora, Ruby, their mom and dad got into the car. Although, it was January and Christmas had passed, Flora’s and Ruby’s mom had said it was the last chance for singing Christmas carols. So Ruby had shouted “Winter Wonderland”, but before she could say anything more, a truck traveling too fast for a snowy evening crossed over the center line and thundered into their car. Flora, Ruby, and her parents were taken to the hospital and Flora and Ruby found out that their parents had died. So they went to live with their grandmother Min in Camden Falls, Massachusetts after the school year got over. There was a welcoming party when they arrived. Flora had a good friend named Olivia Walter (who is a full year younger than Flora, but skipped a grade so she is in the same grade as Flora) who lived in the same strip of row houses called The Row Houses.
