 Bond's Bank, which Mike Bond has inherited from his over-enthusiastically philanthropist uncle Horace, is insolvent. With the examiners due shortly and no solution in sight, Mike faces the prospect of a stretch in the clink for not revealing this earlier.

And Chicago mobster Charlie Yost wouldn't have come along to settle his score with Appleby.
