 The story is narrated by a third-person omniscient narrator who has insight into Mosen Millan's thoughts and feelings. Three distinct planes of narration exist in the novel: the present, Millan's recollections of his relationship with Paco from birth to death; and the ballad the altar boy sings which recounts Paco's life. In the present, Millan, fatigued, prays as he awaits the requiem mass with recollections of Paco's life. As he prays he rests his head against a wall - a habit - which bears a dark spot. The altar boy comes and goes and both remark on the lack of people attending mass. Millan, knowing and feeling guilty knowing that he played a role in Paco's death, asks the altar boy to leave the church to look for mass attenders in the town square when the altar boy sings the parts of the ballad that refer to Millan.
