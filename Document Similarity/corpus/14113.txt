 The book starts out with Kazan, who is 1/4 wolf and 3/4 dog, going up north to the Canadian wilderness with his owner Thorpe where he is greeted by a man known as McCready. From the evidence in the beginning, we are shown that McCready used to own Kazan, then known as "Pedro," and that the former was abusive to the latter. When McCready attacks Thorpes wife Kazan kills him then runs off not returning fearing harsh punishment from knowing he had killed human life. Kazan later joins a wolf pack and hunts with them in the Canadian wilderness. cs:Vlčák Kazan pl:Szara Wilczyca
