 Scorched is a popular narrative which takes its readers on a vivid journey through southern Africaâ€™s mesmerising landscapes as climate change sets in. It delivers an accessible account of the often complex modelling produced by scientific institutions, and gives powerful local colour to a global problem. Scorched ponders the morality of the changes humankind has wrought, and the future of life as we know it.
