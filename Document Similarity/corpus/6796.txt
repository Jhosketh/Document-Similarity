When attempting to enlist Miles' help in preventing a clandestine marriage between his nephew, Stacy, and her niece, Fanny, Abigail finds herself attracted to the black sheep of the Caverleigh family. After rejecting Miles' first proposal, following a series of Heyer-esque twists and turns, Abigail is finally swept off her feet when Miles abducts her and the novel ends with the two on their way to get married.
