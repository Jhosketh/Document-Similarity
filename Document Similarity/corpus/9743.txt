 The novel focuses on Meir, a 42 years old architect from Tel Aviv, who at the beginning of the novel is suddenly stricken with the fear of dying. The novel's plot surrounds the changes in his life following this realization of his mortality, including an affair with his doctor, the death of his mother, and a trip to Europe. The novel ends with a birth following Meir's death, which could be seen as Meir's reincarnation as a baby, or else as a return to his own birth, following Nietzsche's concept of the eternal return.
