 The book tells the first year of a wood thrush's life starting from it hatching in a forest that is in Maryland. Two children see the bird when it is young and calls it Flute. The children wait for Flute to return from migration and watch him and his mate build a nest and raise their young. In Flute's travels, he encounters many dangers. The eggs and nestlings are at more of a risk.
