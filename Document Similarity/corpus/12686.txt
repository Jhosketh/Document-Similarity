 The plot revolves around a family, the Farboroughs who lived in the Eastern Cape of South Africa in the early 1900s, in a small community known as St Matthias. The story follows Walter Brownley, explaining what life was like in South Africa just before the first Boer War. African exploitation, as seen in the mining on the Highveld, is a major theme of the story.
