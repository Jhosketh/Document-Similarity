 The story takes place in the town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. It is recounted from the dog's point of view with animals able to express themselves to each other in English. The protagonist is a Malamute named McKinley, who protects his "human pup," Jack. While helping a runaway greyhound named Duchess, McKinley meets the wolf, Lupin, who is trying to recruit dogs into her shrinking pack. McKinley must deal with Jack's desire to join the wolf pack, protect Lupin from hunters, and figure out how to handle Redburn, an ambitious Irish Setter. By the end of the book, after overcoming many obstacles some with the help of his best friend Aspen, a retriever (breed not specifically named in book) that lives next door, McKinley is transformed from a happy-go-lucky pet into a true leader.
