 The novel, an homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood, is narrated by Hazel "Hazie" Coogan, a lifelong employee and caretaker of aging actress Katherine "Miss Kathie" Kenton. When a suitor named Webster Carlton Westward III manages to weasel his way into Miss Kathie’s heart (and bed), Hazie is suspicious. Upon discovering that Westward has already written a celebrity tell-all memoir foretelling Miss Kathie’s death in a forthcoming Lillian Hellman–penned musical extravaganza, Hazie worries that Westward's intentions may be less than honorable, and may even be deadly.
