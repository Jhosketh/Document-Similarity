 In the poem Rizal praises the benefits that Spain had bestowed upon the Philippines. Rizal had frequently depicted the renowned Spanish explorers, generals and kings in the most patriotic manner. He had pictured Education (brought to the Philippines by Spain) as "the breath of life instilling charming virtue". He had written of one of his Spanish teachers as having brought "the light of the eternal splendor". In this poem, however, it is the Filipino Youth who are the protagonists, whose "prodigious genius" making use of that education to build the future, was the "Bella esperanza de la Patria Mia!" (beautiful hope of the motherland). Spain, with "Pious and wise hand" offered a "crown's resplendent band, offers to the sons of this Indian land."
