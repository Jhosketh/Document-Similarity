 Wolcott takes as his subject matter popular right-wing pundits whom he dubs "attack poodles". These include such TV figures as Bill O'Reilly, Michael Savage, Chris Matthews, Dennis Miller, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Peggy Noonan, and Robert Novak. He asserts their simplistic sloganeering which panders to disaffected Americans is destroying political discourse. Attack Poodles and Other Media Mutants ISBN 1-4013-5212-X
