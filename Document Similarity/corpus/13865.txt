 In Womenomics, Shipman and Kay explore the theory that trends in the current business world have allowed women to leverage their value in order to redefine success. To support this idea, the authors collect evidence showing a concurrent increase in value to companies of female management and increase in priority to women of workplace flexibility. According to the authors, the book functions both to present these findings and to provide "advice, guidance, and fact-based support that proves you donâ€™t have to do it all to have it all." Based on findings from the research done for the book, Shipman and Kay are expanding Womenomics conceptually to include a website incorporating analysis from guest bloggers and news coverage on the shifting roles of women in the workplace.
