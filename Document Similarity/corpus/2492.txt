 In 1992, the author, his wife Cheryl, and their Tibetan horse Sadhu set off on an ancient pilgrimage trail from Lhasa, Tibet, to Kathmandu, Nepal. The original motivation for the journey is to become the first Western couple to complete it. However, there are political and spiritual issues that the couple learn must be reconciled. On their journey through the Himalayan plains they encounter sandstorms, blizzards, high altitude and thin air, as well as political bureaucracy, guns, and uncertainty about food and the next step of their journey. The narrative also describes the couple's warm encounters with Tibetan families along the way, giving insight into 1990s life in Tibet, a country struggling to survive Chinese occupation and cultural destruction--while retaining faith in the Dalai Lama's return.
