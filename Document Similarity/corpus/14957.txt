 Le Chasseur ZÃ©ro is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, and is about a Japanese kamikaze who, in April 1945, manages to sink an American Aircraft carrier off of the island of Okinawa while flying a Mitsubishi A6M. The plot shifts to three months later, when a girl named Laura receives news of her father's death aboard the same carrier. In France, Laura's mother and her grandparents begin to grow apart, and no one will explain to Laura the circumstances of her father's death. She begins to repeatedly hear the screaming sound of the diving Zero in her head and nothing can make the noise stop. The memory of her father's death begins to upset her studies and her relationships.
