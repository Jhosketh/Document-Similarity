 While their Mum is in the hospital and expecting a baby, Joe and his sister Minna are taken to their Granny Diamond's house, as no one else is able to take care of them at this time, because their parents are in the hospital. After showing Joe his room, Granny Diamond tells him about an owl tree outside the house which grows in her neighbour Mr Rock's lawn. She tells him how she had once seen an owl perched on one of the branches of the tree one night and it had cheered her up, which is why she calls it the owl tree. Then one day Joe finds out that Mr Rock is going to cut down the tree soon. After that, Joe tries to find a way to save the tree, as its cutting down could affect his Granny Diamond greatly if it happened. Joe thinks that it is time for him to meet the owl in the owl tree.
