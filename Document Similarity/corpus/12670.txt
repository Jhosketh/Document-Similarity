 The Ice Queen is a nameless woman who makes a wish as an eight-year old child that ruins her life. She grows up cold and unfriendly until, as she stands by her kitchen window, she is struck by a bolt of lightning. She survives but is changed, as if she is made of ice. She can also no longer see the color red. She hears of a man called Lazarus Jones, who also survived being struck by lightning, and is reputed to have a heart and soul made of fire. He came back to life being dead for forty minutes. They embark of a turbulent love affair whilst trying to hide their secrets - how one became full of fire and the other became made of ice.
