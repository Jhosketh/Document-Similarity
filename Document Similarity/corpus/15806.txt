 In his young adulthood Kevin Kelly spent many years traveling remote parts of the developing world, an experience which helped inform his perspective on what he has coined the technium. The opening chapter of What Technology Wants entitled My Question chronicles this period in Kelly's life and gives the reader a sense of how Kelly went from being a nomadic traveler with few possessions to a co-founder of Wired.. Kelly focuses on human-technology relations and argues for the existence of technology as the emerging seventh kingdom of life on earth. What Technology Wants offers the anthropomorphic conception that technology is one giant force — the technium — which Kelly describes as "...a word to designate the greater, global, massively interconnected system of technology vibrating around us".
