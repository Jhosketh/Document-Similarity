 Like in Heller's version of King David's story, God Knows, the author changes little in the storyline of the original â€“ he execrates narrative, and denies historical counterpoints, both explicit, some implicit. Incomprehension may have contributed to a critical redemption of this book, along with less weight for humour and a sobering conclusion.
