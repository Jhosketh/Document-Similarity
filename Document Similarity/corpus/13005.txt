 After having a nightmare about a giant mouse eating the last piece of chocolate in the world, Minnie grabs Moo and the two cows fall out of the bed which causes the bed to start rolling away. They run after it and then they jump on, grabbing other animals on the way down a hill. When they finally come to a stop in town, Moo realizes that it is Halloween night. The animals do lots of tricks so that they can get chocolate. When Minnie goes home, the cow is contented and ready to sleep.
