 At a dinner at the home of his friend, retired Oxford professor Sir Peter Wheeler, he is introduced to Mr. Tupra. Months later he is working for Tupra, giving his interpretations and analysis of the behavior and motivations of wide ranges of people. A flashback to the morning after the dinner reveals that Wheeler worked for M16 during WWII as a psychic, and Tupra does similar work. In their conversation Wheeler tells Deza that he (Deza) shows evidence of being one of the greatest and most perceptive psychics of their kind.
