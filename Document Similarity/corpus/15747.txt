 Wynter Chelsea introduces two families that have been fighting supernatural beings for generations. Depicted as The Wynter Chelsea Legacy, they are the greatest human threat to the evil that walks the earth. Amanda Chelsea belongs to the new generation of fighters and is consequently the only female to ever be born in the legacy. She is shielded from the battles at a young age, therefore growing up with little knowledge of the outside forces that her family faces. The new generation of Wynters and Chelseas acquired gifts at the age of ten. Jack Chelsea has the ability to conjure items out of thin air; Dustin Wynter has the ability of telepathy; Trevor Wynter has the ability of precognition; and Amanda Chelsea has the ability to feel other people's emotions. Amanda's empathic gift has been the source of much turmoil in her life, but her curiosity and need to be in the legacy is the true catalyst. After Amanda rebelliously shoots a supernatural force, her parents mysteriously go missing. The four young adults set out on a journey in an Oldsmobile 442 desperately searching for their parents. Along the way Amanda uncovers secrets that have been buried in her family since she was born. And they all face the danger that their parents may have been taken by the one supernatural being that no Wynter or Chelsea could ever destroy - The Marathaca.
