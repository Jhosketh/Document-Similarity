 The book is set on the city of Itapecerica (then called Vila de Tamanduá), in Minas Gerais. Eugênio and Margarida are two childhood friends who love each other, but following orders of his father, Eugênio is sent to a seminary, in order to become a priest. However, he is not able to forget Margarida, and keeps on dilacerating himself between religiosity and the pleasures of flesh. Despite this he receives his ordination and becomes a priest. Returning to his hometown in order to celebrate his first mass, he discovers that Margarida is very sick and nearly dying. Unable to restrain himself, he and Margarida have amorous relations. Unbeknownst to him, she dies shortly after he leaves. Later on, Eugênio goes on celebrating his first mass — a requiem mass. However, when he discovers that the mass is being made in honor of a deceased Margarida, he has a mental breakdown, and taking off his priest vests, he runs away naked of the church, in a frenzy.
