 Set in and around the fictional coastal town of Moonstair, King of the Trollhaunt Warrens sees players combatting the menace of Skalmad, a self-declared king of the trolls who is able to repeatedly return from death through use of a magical cauldron. Players journey to Skalmad's warren in the Trollhaunt, return to Moonstair to repel an attack by Skalmad's troll army, and finally travel to the faerie realm of the Feywild to destroy the cauldron.
