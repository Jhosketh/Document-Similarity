 Priya has married a handsome young Indian man living in America. Though she has moved from Delhi to Los Angeles - land of Hollywood excess and celebrity craziness - she still lives the life of an obedient Hindu wife: cooking, cleaning and obeying her in-laws in all things.

Because Priya has just become the hottest, most in demand and most envied showbiz reporter in Hollywood. And they would NOT approve.
