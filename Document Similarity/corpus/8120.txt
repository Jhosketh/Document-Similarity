 Following on from the events of The Crystal of Cantus, Collected Works details a year in the life of the Braxiatel Collection following its founder's disappearance. The staff of the Collection have to cope with their new place in the universe, and a visit from a team of post-human scholars from the future, called the Quire. As the year progresses, it becomes clear that even though he has left them, Braxiatel's influence can still be felt on the Collection.
