 This book loosely follows the plots of Animorphs books , Megamorphs #2: In the Time of Dinosaurs and . The book narrates from the reader point of view, as a sixth Animorph, and they are able to choose their morphs as the story progresses. Like all gamebooks, the choices the reader make cause different endings. One of the splits in the story involves Cassie being killed and Rachel forcing the reader to promise not to meddle. If the reader refuses, the others will force them to stay in a fly morph and become a nothlit and they will die but the other split is being in prehistoric time. Unlike other gamebooks, if the reader make a decision that causes them to die, the 'failure' page will refer them to the page that allows the reader to choose another action. Notes are written in bold text at the bottom of certain pages.
