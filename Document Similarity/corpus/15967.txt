 Swanepoel compares modern-day business and personal challenges with the life-and-death struggles of the millions of animals of Serengeti plains of East Africa whose 1,000 mile-long migration filled with hunger, thirst, predators and exhaustion is often considered one of the natural wonders of the world. The book matches a person's dominate instinctive skill with its corresponding Serengeti animal. According to the book the seven skills and animals include the "enduring wildebeest", the "strategic lion", the "enterprising crocodile", the "graceful giraffe", the "efficient cheetah", the "risk-taking mongoose" and the "communicating elephant".
