 Why We Disagree About Climate Change is an exploration on how the idea of climate change has taken such a dominant position in modern politics and why it is so contested. In the book, the author looks at the differing views from various disciplines, including natural science, economics, ethics, social psychology and politics, to try to explain why people disagree about climate change. Rather than being a problem to be solved, the book argues that climate change is an idea which reveals different individual and collective beliefs, values and attitudes about ways of living in the world.
