 Jenna Abbott nearly dies in the car wreck on the bridge that took her mother's life. Broken in body and spirit, she feels lost and alone. She longs for the peace of the "blue" - the drug-filled haze she experienced in hospital - and steals drugs from her uncle's medicine cabinet, setting off on a self-destructive path. Her classmate, the mysterious biker Crow, is the one person she can confide in about her misery and guilt.
