 Davidson seeks to explain how Keynesian economics policies can lead the way out of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010. Davidson explains how the crisis was created, gives an explanation of Keynesian policies, and then offers advice on how to reform the current international trade and monetary systems to conform to Keynes’s ideas. In his appendix, he offers his view that “true” Keynesian theory was never taught in American universities and therefore has not been applied to Economy of the United States.
