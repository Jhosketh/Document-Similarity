 The book starts off with some statistics on American spending habits and why certain things are there (i.e. the warning label) and it eventually concentrates on the American eating habits and some references to his movie. It also talks briefly about how McDonald's started and how much trouble many of their CEOs attempt to carry on Ray Kroc's legacy.
