 The book is set in Paris where Veronique after having just split up with her boyfriend is driving home in her 'little white car' when whilst passing through a tunnel in central Paris is approached at high speed from behind by a large car. She is determined not to let it pass; but it collides with the back of her car and crashes. On seeing the news next morning Veronique realises "Oh shit, I killed the princess". The remainder of the book tells of Veronique's life and loves before the fateful day, and the efforts to conceal her involvement afterwards.
