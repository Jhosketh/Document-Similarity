 Jane Arrowood, an aspiring high school artist, goes swimming at her local beach on June 21st. While in the water, she is attacked by a shark. Injuries due to this attack lead to doctors having to amputate her right arm. When she wakes from her coma, Jane sees her dreams of becoming a professional artist crushed. She spends nearly a month in the hospital, undergoing therapy, where she meets a young boy, Justin, who has had his leg amputated. The two become friends and Justin urges Jane to draw him a picture, though she declines. While she was attacked by the shark, a man took a video of her in the water. This video he then sold to the news, which gained her wide-spread attention. Flowers, cards, and "Pity Bears" arrive every day while she remains in the hospital. Her older brother, Michael, was credited with saving her life. He tied off her arm after he rescued her from the water. Finally, she gets out of the hospital. She returns home, struggling with the fact that she is to never use her right arm again. Jane also loved to cook, something she thinks she no longer can do. She also keeps on trying to draw, but never manages to have her left arm get the circles correct. The story goes on tell of her difficulties about fitting in, but by the end of the book, she accepts who she is. Also, around the end of the book, she finally manages to draw a face that "looks back" at her. These combined allow her to finally overcome her grief.
