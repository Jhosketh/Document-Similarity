 In Oceans of Kansas Everhart discusses the state of the land during the Late Cretaceous and earlier, when the area was covered with water. The geologic record shows that ancient lifeforms such as marine reptiles, pteranodons, and toothed birds inhabited the general area both in and out of the water. Everhart also covers the discovery of the fossils and geographic records as well as the competition between E. D. Cope and O. C. Marsh to collect them.
