 Death comes in many forms, but in Venice death comes by water... It&#39;s the perfect place to hoard secrets. Here the Shadow Queen has her lair, and here she&#39;ll gather her forces for a final battle. Marko and Sorrel are unwitting players in her Last Act as they search for his father, and try to stop the madness claiming hers. In the dark alleyways, on silvery waterways slivers the light lance of the lagoon mist.
