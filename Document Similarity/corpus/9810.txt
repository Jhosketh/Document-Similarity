 Blocher begins by outlining the doctrine of Original Sin in its four parts. Universal sinfulness, the shared culpability of all humanity. Natural sinfulness, the innate or natural tendency to sin in people. Inherited sinfulness, the transmission of the Adam's original sin. Adamic sinfulness the idea that sin had its origin in the Garden of Eden with an act of rebellion by Adam, also known as "The Fall". Blocher then analyses the status of "The Fall" in the context of Genesis, modern science and a wider theological context. Blocher favours the 'framework' interpretation of the early chapters of Genesis, which means he understands "The Fall" as a complex type of 'myth' containg historical elements such as Adam, Eve, the Garden itself and an actual act of original rebellion. The core of the book is centred around Blocher's discussion of Romans 5. In this chapter Blocher compares two common theological views of understanding the "The Fall" with some of his own ideas about the topic. Blocher concludes the book with two chapters about the significance of "The Fall" for humanity and the solution provided by the atonement of Jesus Christ.
