 Two years after the execution of his father (Charles I), 21-year-old Charles II and his men fail miserably to free his kingdom from the tyrannical rule of Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester.

He decides to disguise himself as a peasant and leave England for France so he can free his realm when the right time comes.
