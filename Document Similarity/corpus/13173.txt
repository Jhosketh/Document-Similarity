 Mercuri said, "I first look for a sandwich for which the state is known. The second thing I do is look for a product that's used in sandwiches, a product for which the state is known. And the third criteria I use -- and this is what happened with Kansas -- is I look for historical events that tie into an interesting restaurant". The book has famous sandwich recipes from all over the United States. It is illustrated with historic postcards, license plates, and photographs. Some of the sandwiches included are Colorado's Denver sandwich, Florida's Cuban sandwich, Louisiana's Muffuletta, Montana's Buffalo burgers, Arizona's Navajo taco, and New York's New York Reuben.
