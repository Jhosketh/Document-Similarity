 Brett Messerschmidt is organizing Waverly Academy's annual holiday ball and secret gift exchange. But when some enterprising students decide that playing Secret Satan is infinitely more fun than playing Secret Santa, the entire school starts acting naughty. All Brett wants is a successful party-and a goodnight kiss from unexpected crush Sebastian Valenti. Too bad Callie Vernon also has her eye on the newly made-over Sebastian after breaking up with Easy Walsh. Contradicting, she also seems to still have feelings for her ex... . Everybody at Waverly is getting into the giving spirit. The only present Tinsley Carmichael wants to unwrap is her new boyfriend, Julian McCafferty. But what happens when she uncovers a shady secret from his past instead-that he has already lost his virginity. When did he lose it? Bigger question: Whom did he lose it to? Looks like Jenny Humphrey, Waverly's newest small-screen star, after being chosen to star in a documentary about popular girls, is about to land on Tinsley's hit list. Again. With raucous get-togethers and secret admirers, theres never a dull day in the life of an It Girl. But no one ever said being adored was easy. . .
