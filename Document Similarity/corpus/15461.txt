 The book covers Holloway's ongoing effort to locate his daughter Natalee, who disappeared during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005. He details his experience following leads in crack houses and personally searching landfills. He alleges corruption among the Aruba Police Force, recalling that they asked him how much money he had upon arrival on the island. Holloway accused suspect Joran van der Sloot of repeatedly lying and believes that he is "guilty of something."
