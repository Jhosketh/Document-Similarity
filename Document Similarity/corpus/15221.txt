 Dr. Rostam (Ross) Shaheen, 53, is a world-renowned Iranian-American physicist holding a senior position at the Berkley Lab with extensive expertise in nuclear weapons research and design. His wife of 25 years, Oksana Pugachov, happens to be the only daughter of a high-ranking government official of the Russian Federation. Dr. Shaheen is lured to Iran by the Iranian secret service, MOIS, agents. Amir Meshkin, the head of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, brings Ross to the subterranean plant at Natanz to force him to provide the "missing link" for the project. To ensure Ross' cooperation, MOIS goes to extreme lengths and will stop at nothing to get what they need. With the CIA, Mossad and the Russians all in play, Ross is forced into a dangerous game of chess with deadly, and potentially catastrophic, consequences.
