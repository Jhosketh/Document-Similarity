 Jack and his sister Ellen are suffering in the aftermath of their mother's death, which has caused their father to withdraw into himself. There is some unsolved mystery which Jack tries to explore. To him, the mystery has something to do with the "greylands", a world on the other side of his mirror. Much of the action takes place in these greylands, where Jack meets a strange girl and discovers that his soul is at risk. The adventure is described from Jack's point of view, and within the context of the novel may be a true account of his experiences or a story he is inventing.
