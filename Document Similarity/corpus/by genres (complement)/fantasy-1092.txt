 Aliera has been arrested for practicing Elder Sorcery. The Empire was previously aware of her involvement with this ancient magic, so, naturally, confusion arises over the timing of, and true motivation for, her arrest. Aliera seems unwilling to defend herself, and neither Morrolan or Sethra step in to help her situation. Vlad's curiosity (and respect for his friend) lead him to initiate an investigation into the matter and engagement of an advocate to defend Aliera (despite her objections). Along the way Vlad finds out that the entire affair is all to do with a plot between the Orca, Jhereg and Left hand of the Jhereg.
