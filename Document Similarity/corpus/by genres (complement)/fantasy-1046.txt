 Dragons of the Hourglass Mage reveals the motivations behind Raistlin's aspirations to godhood. After Raistlin Majere became a wizard of the Black Robe, he travels to Neraka, the lord city of the Dark Queen, under the excuse of joining her forces, but in reality, he plots his own rise to power. When Takhisis discovers that the dragon orb has entered her city, she dispatches Draconians to find it and to destroy the wizard who protects it. However, Raistlin uncovers Takhisis' plot to seize control of all magic, and he moves to stop her. Meanwhile, Kitiara uth Matar, Raistlin's older sister, follows Takhisis' orders to set a trap for the Gods of Magic on the Night of the Eye.
