But Ferus does not want to help him, until Palpatine threatens those people closest to his heart. This leaves Ferus with no option but to help Palpatine. Palpatine wishes to use Ferus as an undercover agent - a double-agent. But can Ferus do this and keep his allegiance to the Jedi Order? This book was released in August 2006.
