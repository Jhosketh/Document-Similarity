 The novel features Conan during his buccaneering days. He becomes involved in thwarting a plot to take over the turbulent kingdom of Zingara, complicated by sorcery rooted in the long lost realm of Acheron. At the end of the story he himself has the opportunity to take the Zingaran throne, but uncharacteristically turns it down.
