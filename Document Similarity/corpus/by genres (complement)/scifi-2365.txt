 Illogical! The teachings of Surak emphasise the sacredness of life. Must they be abandoned when the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? T'Pol is forced to confront this dilemma: take a life to save her crewmates, or stay true to her Vulcan nature...From the successful new Star Trek franchise comes the story of its most popular character - the brilliant Vulcan science officer T'Pol. Pulled, once again, into one of Captain Jonathan Archer's headlong rushes for first contact, Sub-commander T'Pol believes her life -- and those of her colleagues -- is threatened. Instinctively she reacts, draws her phaser and kills. A simple act of self-defence. Or was it? As a Vulcan, an alien race under the strictest of self-imposed philosophical regimes, has T'Pol committed the ultimate act of self-betrayal? Has she forsaken the nonviolent teachings of Surak? Captain Archer, T'Pol's superior, believes her new-found pacifism is endangering the entire ship.
