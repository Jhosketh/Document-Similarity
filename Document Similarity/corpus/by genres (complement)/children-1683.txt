 Jean "Jinx" Honeychurch is a sixteen-year-old girl from Iowa. Believing she was born with bad luck, she goes to stay with her Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Ted in Manhattan, New York, to escape the most recent bout of it. Her cousin, Tory, is convinced that Jean must join her coven of "witches". Jean denies being a witch, and refuses to join them. This angers Tory, causing her to seek revenge against her.
