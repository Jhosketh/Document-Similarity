 Kendra is being held captive by the Society of the Evening Star, and her brother Seth Sorenson is depressed at his sister's sudden death. With the help of an anonymous person, Kendra uses a knapsack to escape along with a victim of her captor lectoblix Torina. An undercover agent of the Society of the Evening Star had explained that a lectoblix sucked the youth out of victims previously. Reading Patton Burgess' Journal of Secrets, Kendra learns the location of the key to the Translocator, one of the keys to the demon prison. But in order to recover it, the Knights of the Dawn must take on their biggest and most dangerous task: to enter a dragon sanctuary closed to human interference, a death trap called Wyrmroost. In order to retrieve the key to the Translocator's vault, the team must brave the forbidden Dragon Temple, which brings challenges more dangerous than any before. Gavin's true identity is revealed as Navarog, the evil dragon that was the original occupant of the Quiet Box at Fablehaven. Gavin intends to eat Kendra before Raxtus devoured him. Meanwhile, Kendra returns home in despair of betrayals to hear shocking news.
