 The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories follow the lives of two larcenous but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of Nehwon. In Swords Against Wizardry the duo consults a witch in regard to an upcoming adventure ("In the Witch's Tent"), ascends Stardock, the Nehwonian Everest, in search of treasure ("Stardock"), are revealed, as they are gypped of their gains afterwards, not to be the best thieves in Lankhmar, as they so smugly deem themselves ("The Two Best Thieves in Lankhmar"), and take service with two opposing claimants to the sorcerous throne of the ancient city of Quarmall ("The Lords of Quarmall").
