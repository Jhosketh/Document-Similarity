 George makes a mess with ink and a fountain pen and tries to wash it away with the garden hose, but the room fills with water and he hurries to a nearby farm to get a portable pump. He is chased by the farmer but eludes him by entering a museum. He makes another mess with a dinosaur display but Professor Wiseman wants him to go up in a space ship and then bail out. George agrees and is given a tiny space suit. At the critical moment, it is uncertain whether George will jump or not, but he does and the experiment is a success. George is carried to Earth by a parachute and is awarded a medal.
