 The book starts off with Peter sitting in a room talking to a counselor. This is to see how he is getting on in the outside world as a "Legal". He tells the counselor he has finally agreed to go work for his grandfather who makes Longetivity drugs which lets people live forever. The counselor is thrilled but Peter is only going to work there to help the Underground, an organization which believes that the Longevity drug is evil and is trying to destroy it.
