 With a cast of unforgettable characters and a pace that never lets up the third Vampirates adventure is Grace and Connorâ€™s most spectacular voyage so far. For Connor these are testing times aboard the Diablo and he finds himself crossing a line from which there is no return. Grace also faces danger as she travels with Lorcan to Sanctuary, a place of healing presided over by Vampirate guru, Mosh Zu.
