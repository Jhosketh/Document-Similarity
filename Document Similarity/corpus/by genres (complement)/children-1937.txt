 Amy and Dan head for Egypt, with their au pair Nellie Gomez, to find a clue, hidden by Ekaterina founder, Katherine Cahill. They were tailed by Irina Spasky, but escape to a store with an Egyptian goddess statue, the Sakhet. There, a man, Theo Cotter, shows up and convinces them it's a fake. Discouraged, they go back to Nellie. They go to the Hotel Excelsior and find the Ekaterina stronghold. They find three Sakhets and get trapped by Bae Oh, who is the hotel's owner. As they escape, one of Grace's friends, Hilary Vale, takes them to her house. She gives them items from Grace and they find out Theo is Hilary's grandson. They head for an Egyptian temple and get trapped by Irina and Theo. After Amy and Dan had escaped, they are trapped again by Jonah Wizard, who leaves them on a deserted island on the Nile. After Jonah left them, they are chased by a crocodile across the island, but are saved by a local fisherman. They find out Theo and Hilary Cotter tricked them to get their hands on the Sakhet that Grace left for Amy and Dan. After an unsuccessful attempt to find the clues under the Nile river with Alistair, Amy and Dan find something leading them back to Cairo. After arriving, they find a store which Grace once visited. The store owner, Sami, gives them a Senet board. After opening the puzzle, they identified their clue, Myrrh. It ends with the stronghold getting destroyed, and Amy and Dan finding a mysterious cloth with letter Ms in a pattern, indicating that it must have been the Madrigals.
