 The book opens up to Joe "Stosh" Stoshack's Social Studies teacher informing him about his D in that class. Later that day, Joe has a baseball game, and is about to be the winning run when the 3rd baseman, Joe's enemy Bobby Fuller, holds him back by grabbing his belt, causing him to be out in a play at the plate.
