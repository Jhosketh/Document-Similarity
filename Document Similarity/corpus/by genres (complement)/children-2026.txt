 Mary "Molly" Jemison lives with her family on a Pennsylvania farm, until one morning she is taken captive by Indians who raid her home, separate her from her family, and take her and two other captives to the French Fort Duquesne. There she is bought by two Seneca Indian sisters: Shining Star, who is kind and beautiful, and Squirrel Woman, who is stern and cross. They adopt her as their Indian sister to replace their brother who died in Pennsylvania. They call her "Corn Tassel" because her soft yellow hair reminds them of corn in full tassel. There, she learns to be an Indian women, to bear her pain silently, to speak Seneca, to work for food, and learns the place of an Indian woman. She befriends a young hunter, Little Turtle, and wise old Grandfather Shagbark, who are both kind to him and only want her to be happy. At the end of the book she has the choice to go home with an English captain and get all the training she would have had as a white girl or to stay living as an Indian. She chooses to stay with them, earning the name "Little woman of great courage."
