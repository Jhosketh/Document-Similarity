 A twisted adaptation of Robinson Crusoe, the story's protagonist, Robert Maitland, a wealthy architect, finds himself stranded in a manmade 'island' (a section of fenced-off wasteland in the middle of a motorway intersection) between the Westway and an imagined spur of the M4 Motorway in west London, and is forced to survive on only what is in his crashed Jaguar and what he is able to find.
