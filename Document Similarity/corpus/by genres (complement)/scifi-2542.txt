 "Suppose you were murdered and then woke up 300 years earlier in someone else's body. Wouldn't you want to put yourself in suspended animation and be re-awoken in time to prevent yourself from being murdered in the first place? This is the extraordinary tale of an ordinary man in a race across Time."
