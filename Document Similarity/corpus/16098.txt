 13-year-old Ally lives at a campsite called The Moon Shadow where she is homeschooled by her parents along with her 10-year-old brother Kenny. Although they don't have phone reception and have barely seen any TV in their lives, Ally loves The Moonshadow and her dream is to find one of the Messier Objects. She then discovers that her family is going to move to the city and she will be put in public school. Meanwhile, 13-year-old Bree is the most popular girl in her school and proud of it. She wants to become a Prom Queen in high school and eventually be on the cover of Seventeen magazine before she's seventeen. Her nerdy family however, has other plans. She and her 10-year-old sister, Melanie are going to move to The Moon Shadow and take the place of Ally and her family as the caretakers of the campsite. Bree is appalled at the thought of moving and doesn't want to be homeschooled in the middle of nowhere,with no boys, no friends, and no chance of any model coming up to her and giving her a job offer. 13-year-old Jack only finds comfort in reading and drawing in his treehouse. His mom has been married four times and he has no friends, as well as being shy and slightly overweight. After failing science, he is faced with the choice of either attending summer school or going to The Moonshadow to watch an eclipse with his teacher. He chooses to go to The Moon Shadow. Eventually, all three children meet each other at The Moon Shadow and form a unlikely friendship. Bree and Ally plot to convince their parents to change their minds about the move, but they fail in their attempt.
