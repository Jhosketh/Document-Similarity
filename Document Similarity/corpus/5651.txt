 Santiago Moore Zamora leads a dissolute life of wanton drug-fuelled homosexuality in London, selling his body to despised clients. The story then takes us back to his privileged childhood in the late 1950s. His Spanish mother and English father are surrounded by servants and young 'Iago' sees as much of nanny, cook and gardener as he does his parents who send him off to boarding school. At his prep school he becomes James Moore and at age nine he is abused by a teacher, Mr Wolfe. Moving on to an English public school, James encounters the music teacher, Dr. Fox, who persuades him to attend piano lessons and abuses him for the next few years.
