 The story is narrated by Asterix: he tells of his early childhood (when he was about six years old) when Obelix was shy, overweight and bullied. After the other kids picked on Obelix one too many times, Asterix decided to help him by getting him to drink some of Getafix' magic potion when the village men went out to beat up Romans, but Obelix slipped and fell in â€” being rescued by Getafix when the battle was over.
