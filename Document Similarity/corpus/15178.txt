 This is a story about a young man, Ezio Auditore, seeking revenge for the killing of his family. On his mission for vengeance he finds out truths about his father and his father's history. Guided by assassins, his skill as an assassin is honed until finally he is one of them. Ezio becomes involved in a war between the Assassin Order and the Knights Templar, who both seek an ancient Vault in Italy which contains super-advanced technology that can alter human minds. Set entirely in 15th century Italy, the plot features non-fictional characters such as Rodrigo Borgia, who is here portrayed as the antagonist. Unlike the game Assassin's Creed II, it does not span over a vast period of time (the game's plot also takes place as late as 2012) and takes its own liberties for the sake of creativity. There is no mention of the modern day events of the Assassin's Creed universe, including Desmond Miles looking back on his ancestor's memories. Some of the book, including Ezio's long-running relationship with Christina, were left out of the novel and were instead included as playable repressed memories in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.
