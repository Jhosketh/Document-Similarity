 Set during the American financial recession in 2008, the college dropout Miles Heller, who has been running from his past for seven years, is forced to leave his new girlfriend in Florida and return home to New York. There he unites with his old friend Bing who lives together with 2 women in an abandoned home in the Sunset Park neighborhood in Brooklyn. Through several situations of coincidence and self-discovery, it is a story about how to reconnect with a world once left behind, and how to rejoin the human race after self-inflicted exile.
