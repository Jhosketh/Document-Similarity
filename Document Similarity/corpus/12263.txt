 Farah Ahmedi was born in Kabul, Afghanistan near the end of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. When she was in second grade, she stepped on a land mine while taking a shortcut through a field to school. Farah was transferred to Germany where her leg was amputated. After over eighteen months in Germany, she returned to her home in Kabul. Shortly after she returned home, her father and sisters were killed by a stray rocket while Farah and her mother were shopping for fabrics, and her two brothers left Afghanistan in order to avoid a draft. Fearing for their lives, Farah and her mother fled to Pakistan where they endured harsh conditions in refugee camps for a couple years before World Relief rescued them and provided them a home in Chicago, Illinois. In Chicago, Farah and her mother began to adjust to their new life in Chicago, with major help from Alyce Litz, one of Farah's new friends.
