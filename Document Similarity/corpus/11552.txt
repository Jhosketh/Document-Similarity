 The residents of Pickax take pride in a town which has considerably less crime than the places "Down Below." However, this holiday season has seen a streak of small crimes. New in town is the bank manager, Willard Carmichael and wife Danielle. Her cousin wants to historically restore Pleasant Ave, but something seems amiss to Qwill. Two deaths soon follow. One of the victims is a prominent figure of Pickax and the other is Willard.
