 Lunatic picks up where Chaos left off. Johnis, Silvie, and Darsal have returned from the other earth, having claimed all of the lost books of history only to lose them again. More importantly, the world that they have returned to has changed completely. Their home is overrun by their enemies and the healing water of Elyon no longer heals. Much as the first four books of the series make a set, Lunatic and Elyon are a whole story of their own. One difference is that in the first four books, each had an individual story that would be followed through to completion before leaving the main story to be continued. Lunatic and Elyon are one story, completely incomplete without each other.
