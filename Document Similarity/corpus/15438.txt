 (from the paragraph on the back of the paperback) Cee Cee is back in this sequel which picks up where the original novel Beaches left off. CC now faces the ups and downs of being a mother with Nina now living with her, CC's Career is going well especially after she runs across her first pianist that helped her launch her career way back when. Intentionally drawn to mirror the Barry Manilow-Bette Midler partnership of the early 70's in real life, Harold becomes very close to both Nina and CC. But with TWO show business people around all the time, Nina finds herself giving in to drugs and alcohol from the turmoil of life in the cast-off limelight. Somehow the two get through the trials of a new relationship, but not all is peaches and cream for the pair. Will this be a Happily Ever After? Find out in this second wonderful novel by Iris Rainer Dart.
