 The novel is written in diary form. It starts with Hollywood at her Convent School. The Reverend Mother tells Holly she has received a call from her mother, asking her to come back to London to live with her because Kandhi is worried about security. Hollywood returns to New York to find her new deluxe home halfway through renovation. Meanwhile her mum is filming a new movie, and when she announces she is going to be married to her British co-star, Hollywood is not happy.
