 Lucky Luke involves himself in a quarrel between peaceful farmers and unscrupulous (and fattened-up) ranchers who indiscriminately drive their cattle right across the farmers' crops in search of new pastures. The only way the farmers can see to stop this continual rampage is to use the titular material to fence off and protect their land: barbed wire. With the assistance of Lucky Luke, both sides eventually come to realize that without greens there can be no meat, and the matter is settled in the usual happy-end manner.
