She discovers that each letter on each box represents the continent that the shell came from, and that her grandfather intends her to put them back where they came from over her lifetime. Meanwhile, Jason, Margaret's brother, is left with a camera and uses it to construct multiple photo albums, one of which consisted of a girl doing ordinary things throughout the day, only she is holding a large piece of glass.
