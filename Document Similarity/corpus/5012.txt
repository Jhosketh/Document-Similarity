 Having fallen foul of his erstwhile comrades in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Henry escapes to America. In New York, he becomes involved in advertising, pornography and bootlegging. After stepping on the toes of the Mob, Henry heads for Chicago, where he becomes the manager and partner-in-crime of Louis Armstrong. He becomes reunited with his wife and daughter, and, much to his dismay, the IRA.
