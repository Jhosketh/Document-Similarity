 O Chifrudo is a comedy that requires actors with great experience and versatility. This text gave opportunity to the author, Miguel M. Abrah√£o, to reassess, on his way, one of the most common themes and best known in world literature: the love triangle. The story is not focused on the content melodramatic as one would predict. First and foremost is an acid criticism of consumerism. Dayse, the woman is presented to the public as consumer object, just as Hermes, her husband, her lover, Dondoco, or even the two neighboring, whose profiles are comically different. With surprise ending and original, the piece always captivated audiences in the country and gave great opportunities to actors in search of roles that allow for true theatrical performance and not the easy laughter and obvious humor of modern.
