 Kagerō Nikki focuses on the development of Mother of Michitsuna's relationship with Fujiwara no Kaneie ("the Prince") and how these experiences affect her. The diary entries detail events of particular emotional significance, such as when Kaneie visits other women while she stays at home taking care of their son ("the boy"). Mother of Michitsuna's deep feelings for Kaneie are apparent in the way her words take on a tone of inner anguish as Kaneie's visits dwindle. In an attempt to find solace, Mother of Michitsuna makes various pilgrimages to temples and mountains of religious importance. She often desires to become a nun, but the effect that act would have on her son’s future plagues her mind, and prevents her from ever taking Buddhist vows. Towards the end of the diary, she finally reconciles herself to her separation with Kaneie and devotes herself to caring for her son and adopted daughter.
