 It was a chance meeting on a steamboat in 1852 between a young woman of nineteen named Theresa Longworth and a soldier in his thirties Charles Yelverton, heir to the title of Viscount Avonmore. After a five-year clandestine romance hidden from the public eye, the affair blossomed until they finally got married in secret in Edinburgh. The following summer they remarried in Dublin again in secret but in the presence of a priest. This was at the request of Theresa who was a Roman Catholic while Charles Yelverton had been brought up a Protestant. The validity of the marriage was later questioned in court.
