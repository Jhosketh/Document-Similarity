 Disturbed by the heat and humidity of Calcutta in June, (combined with frequent electricity failures) the "Three Musketeers", Prodosh C. Mitter (Feluda), Topshe, and Lalmohon Babu (alias Jatayu) go to Puri for vacation. There they find that not everybody is there for their holidays. The mystery revolves around Mr. DG Sen, an elderly gentleman, who has the hobby of collecting rare 'Puthis' (old hand written books/manuscripts). He is a true collector and denies lucrative offers from prospective buyers. However, a group of people are determined to steal the most valuable manuscripts from his collection. The story takes a big turn when one of the prime suspects is found to be murdered. The climax takes place at the beaches of Puri.
