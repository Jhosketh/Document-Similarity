 The Chinese have ruined several American intelligence operations in recent months. David Hawk, head of AXE, believes that the Chinese have recruited a new paymaster, able to reach top people in various governments and get them to pass along sensitive information.

Nick Carter is sent on the next flight and, although his cover is almost immediately broken, he escapes several attempts on his life before uncovering the airline public relations man as the head spy.
