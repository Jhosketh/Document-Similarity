 This novel follows two separate characters: Princess Eleanor of England and a young fairy named Joyce. Joyce lives in Swinley Forest with a community of other fairies who rely on the forest's unicorn for survival. But one day, Joyce follows the unicorn to the edge of the forest and is spotted by Princess Eleanor. The Princess chases her inside and finds the unicorn, only to take home with her to Swinley Castle. Knowing it's her responsibility to retrieve the unicorn, Joyce sets out on a journey to bring the unicorn home. But things get a little more complicated when the Princess takes the unicorn with her to London. Meanwhile, the Princess isn't living the dream life like most little girls would assume. Instead she rarely gets to see her parents, who are too busy with their affairs to tuck her in at night. And her once lovable nanny is brewing a deceptive get-rich-quick scheme behind the Princess's back.
