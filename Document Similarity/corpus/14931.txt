 It's summer time in Camden Falls and Flora, Ruby, Olivia and Nikki are planning what to do. But Flora, Ruby, Olivia, and Nikki don't understand it. An element of mystery is instantly added when someone - they don't know who - is leaving books on their doorstep. Each comes with a mysterious message, asking them to read the book and do something new. Before they know it, the four friends have a secret girls-only book club - and are finding out new things about themselves and one another. There are some very interesting ties between the books they're reading and the things they're facing over the summer. The girls don't need to read Nancy Drew to track down the answer, because Flora and Ruby's legal guardian and grandmother tell them and Olivia and Nikki when she and the literary benefactor think it's time to. The girls find it annoying that their parents know who the 'mystery book sender' is, but won't tell them. But they have a wonderful time reading some pleasingly wonderful books like Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, etc. So Min, the girls, and the book sender travel to Sands Point as a reward.
