 This adventure takes place in modern France and uses the normal continuing storyline of the series. Lapinot meets with all his friends for an evening in the apartment he shares with his girlfriend Nadia. There, a tarot card reader predicts someone in the room will die before the next day. Lapinot and Nadia break up and pretty much all the other characters suffer various misfortunes: for example, Richard is beaten up and falls into a coma, and Titi is diagnosed with cancer. It turns out to be Lapinot, the main character of the series, who dies as the story finishes. After the book's publication, as Trondheim hinted that he one day might come out of his semi-retirement, he explained in his book Désoeuvré that the death of his character didn't exclude the possibility of seeing him again in stock historical settings or in modern day flashbacks before his death. This however hasn't happened as of 2009.
