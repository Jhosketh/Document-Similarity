 Dr. Vance, who grew up poor in Blairtown, returns there from Pittsburgh, where he runs a clinic for the underprivileged. He shares a taxi with wealthy Emily Blair, a snobbish rich girl he never liked while growing up together, but she has since contracted meningitis and is deaf. Emily has postponed her wedding to Jeff Stoddard, a member of high society like herself, while leaving town to seek treatment. In her absence, her sister Janice has fallen in love with Jeff, but they don't know how to break the news to Emily. Although the doctor doesn't usually care for upper-class patients and Emily doesn't wish to be used as a guinea pig, she agrees to an experimental treatment. It causes Emily to go into a coma, but ultimately her hearing returns. She realizes the depth of her feelings for Dr. Vance, which clears the way for Janice and Jeff.
