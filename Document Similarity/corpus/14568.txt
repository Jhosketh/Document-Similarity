 In Montecore, the author Jonas Hassen Khemiri receives an e-mail from Kadir, a childhood friend of Jonas’ father. Kadir urges Jonas to write a book about the father, a famous photographer who has disappeared. Kadir’s letters are mixed with Jonas’ memories from his own childhood. Inspired by Kadir, he writes a story about coming to age in a country where tolerance and diversity are the bywords of the day, but where racism and xenophobia form part of everyday life.
