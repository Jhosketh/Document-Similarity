 The graphic novel leaps between the tale of a prince in the 9th century and another prince in the 13th century whose destinies are linked by a prophecy. The graphic novel begins with Guiv, a prince who had attempted to kill his brother Layth, fleeing the city of Marv after escaping death by drowning from Layth's guards. The story then jumps to a young woman, Shirin, who flees the city of Marv in the 13th century in an attempt to escape her father. She soon meets up with Ferdos, a young man who is connected to Guiv through a prophecy. What follows are two separate adventures which lead both princes to their destinies. fr:Prince of Persia (bande dessin√©e) pt:Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel
