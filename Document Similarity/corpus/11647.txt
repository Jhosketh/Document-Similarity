 Lucky encounters a wandering theater troupe, whose specialty play is the titular drama, "Le Cavalier Blanc" (literal translation: The White Cavalier). But in each town where they perform, a major robbery takes place right during the climactic end scene. His suspicions aroused, Lucky Luke decides to keep a sharp eye on the group, but in the course of his investigation nearly ends up being framed as the culprit twice. Only with the help of a repentant member of the troupe can he bring the culprits to justice.
