 Hollis Henry and Milgrim find themselves in London working for Hubertus Bigend, unaware that their lives previously crossed in Spook Country. One of Bigend's current interests is fashion, particularly the intersection between streetwear, workwear and military clothing. He asks Henry and Milgrim to investigate a secret brand, named Gabriel Hounds after the English legend. At the same time, he becomes aware that a coup is being plotted within his company, Blue Ant. During the course of the novel, Milgrim is threatened by others in what is implied to be a corporate espionage plot suborned by rogue members of the United States military. A parallel subplot tracks Hollis as she tracks down Garreth, the mysterious daredevil featured in Spook Country, and the Gabriel Hounds designer, implied but not expressly stated to be Cayce Pollard.
