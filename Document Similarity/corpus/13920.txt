 Henry has a green pencil with a skull eraser. He discovers that everything he writes or draws with it becomes true! But if he draws good things, a bad thing will unexpectedly happen. He tries to destroy the pencil in many ways, and gives his friend Jack Japes amnesia in the process by tripping him down a hill . He throws it into a rubbish bin, hoping it will never be seen again, but it turns up again in Lost Property. He wedges it under the sports teacher's Hummer's wheel, but instead it sticks into it, and the Hummer collides with Mrs Cross' small green hatchback. He also attempts to crush it in Mr Spade's compactor, but not knowing how to use it, it blows up and the pencil is left intact. He attempts to draw a picture of the pencil itself disappearing, but because of how wishes don't always come true in the way people expect, it gets stolen by Clive, who use it to draw a picture of Henry and his friends being crushed under an avalanche. Luckily (or unluckily), they get crushed by an avalanche... of books. The combined weight of the books also crushes the pencil. The characters are saved by the librarian, Mr Shush, who digs them out. The story ends here with the usual paragraph.
