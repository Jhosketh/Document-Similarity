 Cohen follows the story of a man named Sead who had been searching for his lost father. Cohen goes on to describe the lives of three other families, one Muslim-Serb, one Muslim, and one Serb-Croat. He details the history of Yugoslavia from the end of World War I onward and then shows how the Yugoslav Wars affected the daily lives of ordinary people. He states that, in general, "This was a war of intimate betrayals". He blasts leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic, whom he calls "a craven, clever bully", Franjo Tuđman, whom he says played a "macabre dance", and Radovan Karadžić. He writes with outrage against the United States and the United Nations for what he sees as their moral cowardice in the wake of genocide.
