 Jack Stapleton is a New York City medical examiner whose infant son, JJ, has neuroblastoma. To take his mind off of his son's medical troubles, Stapleton becomes embroiled in a case about the unexplained death of a healthy young woman who had been seeing a chiropractor for alternative medical treatments. Two of Jack's college friends, one an archaeologist and one a Catholic bishop, become similarly embroiled in a case in Egypt, where recent discoveries suggest scientific/medical explanation for Biblical miracles. Also, new information is found that questions the veracity of information in the Christian Bible. Using 21st century medical technology, Jack and his friends discover that a Palestinian woman, Jamilla Mohammod, may be a direct descendant of Mary. Towards the end of the novel, Jack Stapleton's archaeologist friend Shawn and his wife are killed and Stapleton's bishop friend James blames himself for their death. Curious and perhaps desperate, Stapleton and his wife bring JJ to Israel, where he is held by Jamilla. Later, when examined in a hospital in Jerusalem, JJ's neuroblastoma has vanished.
