 The novel's protagonist is Tim, a boy, who befriends a girl (Sarre) from another world. The two travel to a fantastic kingdom where an evil duke is plotting malevolence and where huge birds, used as transport, are menaced by disease spores. With the help of a group of roving merchants and minstrels, and a warrior, the children save the kingdom.
