 In 1958, many nations chaff under colonial rule, with several groups looking to throw off the yoke of such rule, sometimes with the aid of the Soviets. In a flash back, we find a young Mortimer, just before going to college, returning to Indian to visit his parents. There he also meets a young Blake, and tries to rekindle a boyhood friendship with a native Indian. He also meets Princess Gita, the daughter of the resurrected "Ashoka the Great" which ends tragically, making a future enemy of him. In 1958, Blake and Mortimer visit the Universal Exposition (World Fair) in Brussels, as Mortimer is involved with the planning of the UK pavilion. But they have to contend with an attack by unknown terrorists using a mysterious force. The terrorists are led by "Ashoka", and using Colonel Olrik.
