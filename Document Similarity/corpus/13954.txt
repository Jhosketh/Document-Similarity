 The story is divided into three parts, called "epochs". The "Jonathan Wild" epoch comes first. The events of the story begins with the notorious criminal and thief-catcher Jonathan Wild encouraging Jack Sheppard's father to a life of crime. Wild, who once pursues Sheppard's mother, eventually turns Sheppard's father into the authorities and he is soon after executed. Sheppard's mother is left to raise Sheppard, a mere infant at the time, alone. Paralleling these events is the story of Thames Darrell. On 26 November 1703, the date of the first section, Darrell is removed separated from his immoral uncle, Sir Rowland Trenchard, and is given to Mr. Wood to be raised. The third epoch takes place in 1724 and spans six months. Sheppard is a thief that spends his time robbing various people. While he and Blueskin rob the Wood's household, Blueskin murders Mrs. Woods. This upsets Sheppard and results in his separation from Wild's group. Sheppard befriends Thames again and spends his time trying to correct Blueskin's wrong. * Jack Sheppard * Jonathan Wild * Thames Darrell * Mr. Wood * Mrs. Wood * Winifred Wood * Blueskin â€“ Joseph Blake * Thomas Sheppard
