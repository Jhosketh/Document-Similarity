 A teenage girl is troubled by dreams and fantasies that parallel the life of another girl who lived over 200 years before. The book revolves around a young New Englander, Amy Delatour, a teenager of French Acadian-English lineage, who often goes into a fugue stage where she believes she is a tormented soul named Ange-Marie, a French Acadian in exile in eighteenth century Connecticut who had been separated from her beloved husband, Paul. The shy and bookish Amy lives in a state of anguish and uncertainty, until one of her high school teachers, Martin Stone, takes an interest in this unusual, highly intelligent young woman. Together they try to get to the bottom of her mysterious dream states and her fire phobia.
