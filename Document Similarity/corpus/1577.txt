 Ruins of Adventure contains four linked Forgotten Realms miniscenarios set in the ruined town of Phlan. The scenarios form the core of the Pool of Radiance computer game, and include clues to that game's solution. The adventurers are hired to remove evil forces from Phlan, presumably by killing them. They hear rumor of a Boss controlling them and seek him out. This Boss proves to be a worthy adversary, but in the end the adventurers defeat him.

These locations include: * Kovel Mansion * The Slum District * The Temple of Bane * Kuto's Well * Mantor's Library * Stojanow Gate * Podol Plaza * The Cadorna Textile House * Valhingen Graveyard * Valjevo Castle * Sorcerer's Island * Zhentil Keep Outpost There are numerous pre-generated characters in this book.
