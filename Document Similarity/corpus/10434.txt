 Renovation of the Heart proposes that the human self is made up of several interrelated components: one's spirit, i.e. one's "heart" or "will"; one's mind, or the collection of one's thoughts and feelings; the body; one's social context; and one's soul. Willard argues that one's identity is largely a function of how those components are subordinated to one another, and whether the whole is subordinated to God. Willard argues that popular rejection of subordination to God and the dominance of the body and feelings has resulted in addictions and futile pursuits of stimulation for the body or feelings. Willard argues that the subordinated alignment of one's being can be corrected through apprenticeship to Jesus Christ, which renovates one's heart.
