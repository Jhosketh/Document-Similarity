 The book starts with Molly and Michael (brother and sister) arguing with their mom because they found out that they are moving to the country. The house used to be a church and has a graveyard located near it. Heather, a 7-year-old girl, still does not trust Molly (stepsister), Michael (stepbrother), and their mother, Jean (stepmother). She tends to stay close with her daddy, Dave. When Molly hears of Heather having a ghostly friend, she immediately watches her every move, causing later arguments to occur. While Molly tries to have a sisterly relationship with Heather, Heather continues to deny the trust given to her. Heather threatens Molly later on that if she continues to bother and "spy" on her and Helen, "Wait Till Helen Comes". Helen comes while Heather, Jean, and Dave are gone and destroys Molly, Michael, and Jean's room. Molly sees Helen, but no one believes her. Helen gives Heather a locket, and later while Jean and Dave are gone, Heather sneaks out to see helen. Molly follows Heather and Helen, while Helen tries to lure Heather into a pond and drown her, but Molly saves Heather. While Molly gives Heather CPR, Helen comes back to get Heather. Molly takes the locket and throws it at Helen. She runs after it. Molly tries to escape, dragging Heather behind, and falls into a hole where they found Helens parent's bones. Molly finds out that Helen had killed her parents by accidentally setting a fire, just like how Heather accidentally played with the stove that started a fire that killed her mother when she was three. Once Molly and Heather are found and rescued, the parents' bones are removed and buried with their daughter. Helen is finally at rest and Molly comes to love and care for her stepsister.
