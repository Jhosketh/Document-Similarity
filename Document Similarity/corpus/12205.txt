 Sophomore Tom Brautigan couldn't wait to get back to Chandler College. Away from his parents' divorce. Away from his suicidal brother. Back to the relative insanity of dorm life. Senior Elsie Barnum is just a few months away from graduation. After a string of bad decisions, including sleeping with a professor, Elsie grows increasingly desperate in her outlook on life. Both Tom and Elsie are searching for something at Chandler College...is it each other?
