 Wither follows Wendy, a young college student living in the fictional town of Windale, Massachusetts. She attends local Danfield College, of which her father is the president, while indulging her interest in the magic and New Age. It's an idylic setting, but evil is slowly creeping into the town in the form of the ghost of Elizabeth Wither. Eight year old Abby MacNeil suffers from nightmares that eventually result in her discovering the burial site of three 17th century women that were tried and killed by the townspeople. Karen Glazer, a local professor, has vivid visions of her unborn child being attacked. Eventually they discover that Wither and her fellow witches are intent on possessing the bodies of Wendy, Abby, and Karen.
