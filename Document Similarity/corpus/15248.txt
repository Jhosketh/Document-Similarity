 Over sixteen chapters the authors present their view of the natural cycles in the earth's climate and argue that the current warming period is not caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The book begins with the earth's climate time-line, starting from the formation of the earth 4.5 billion years ago, and leading up to the Modern Warm Period. The book ends with a chapter entitled "The ultimate failure of The Kyoto Protocol", which predicts that the Protocol will be unsuccessful in curtailing emissions. It covers the localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union and what the book says is Russia's excess amount of Carbon Credits which, the book argues, will be purchased by European nations to offset their rising emissions.
