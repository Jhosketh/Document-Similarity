 After Hurricane Katrina devastates his beloved city of New Orleans, Dave Robicheaux is drawn into the fatal shooting of two young black looters, and the subsequent torture murder of a third. Soon several suspects, including an insurance salesman whose daughter may have been brutally raped by the men, and a sadistic gangster whose house they raided, start emerging from the woodwork. However, the investigation becomes much more personal for Dave when his own family comes under threat from an evil sociopath, and he finds himself drowning in a sea of violence, degeneracy and corruption, juxtaposed against the terrible suffering he sees everyday as a result of the hurricane.
