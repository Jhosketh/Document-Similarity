 The book tracks Sandusky's life from his youth in Washington, Pennsylvania, his adoption of six children, at least one of whom he allegedly molested, and taking in six foster children, his years as a player and coach at Penn State, and his work with the Second Mile charitable organization. According to one review of the book, "Sandusky writes equally of his time in and out of football. Most of his time away from the game is devoted to his family and his charitable foundation, the Second Mile, which serves underprivileged children. Interesting anecdotes from all aspects of his life are neatly packaged with the help of Kip Richeal, a 1987 Penn State graduate and former equipment manager for the football team."
