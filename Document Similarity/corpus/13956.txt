 The plot begins with Lady Jane Grey, wife of Guilford Dudley and daughter-in-law to the Duke of Northumberland, as she enters the Tower of London on 10&nbsp;July 1553. Prior to her entrance into the Tower, she ruled as Queen of England for nine days after she and her husband were put on the throne by the Duke of Northumberland. Soon after, Mary I was able to take control of England and sent the Duke to be executed. Dudley, in order to gain back the kingdom, formed a rebellion, which results in failure and the imprisonment of both himself and his wife. After the imprisonment, Simon Renard, the Spanish Ambassador to England, arranges a marriage between Mary and Philip of Spain in order to bring a Catholic take over of England. The events of the book alternate between historical background and the plot of Lady Jane. In Book II, incidents throughout the history of England from William the Conqueror to the 1820 Cato Street conspiracy are mentioned. The novel returns to Lady Jane busying herself with prayer as she awaits her execution with her only hope for freedom is to become a Catholic. * Lady Jane Grey * Guilford Dudley * John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland * Mary I * Philip of Spain * Xit (Sir Narcissus Le Grand) * Og, Gog and Magog * Winwike * Cuthbert Cholmondeley * Mistress Cicely * Nightgall * Elizabeth The novel is illustrated with 40 engravings and 58 woodcuts by Cruikshank.
