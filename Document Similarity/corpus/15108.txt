 The Createst Man In Cedar Hole is a novel about small-town life, growing up, and, above all, what it takes to be great. Cedar Hole is a mossy, dank town where only the grass seems to possess ambition. Trapped for generations by their lack of initiative, imagination, and optimism, the contentious locals feel bonded only by their distrust of the outside world. The pallor of lackluster Cedar Hole is only magnified by its neighboring community, Palmdale, a comparatively upper crust, gentrified community where the houses are as superior to those of Cedar Hole as the people who live within them. Into this gloomy world are born two boys, Robert J. Cutler and Francis "Spud" Pinkham. Yet their tie to Cedar Hole is their only commonality as they couldn't be more different. Like Cedar Hole, Francis lacks confidence, vitality or distinction while Robert is a preternaturally wise, courteous boy who effortlessly earns the admiration of those around him. Forced for much of his life to exist in the dark, deeply etched shadow of Robert's accomplishments, Francis struggles against everyone's expectations (including his own) to find his own niche of success and happiness.
