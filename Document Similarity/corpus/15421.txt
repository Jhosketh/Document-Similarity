 Kira is a girl whose life is governed by the first law: all girls must marry at age 13. When the Lord Dorcon and the king's men come to arrest her family, Kira and her younger sister Elspeth run away. Led by a fox named Onnie, they take shelter on Rogue's mountain, home to Ferarchie, the most ferocious dragon in the land. They rescue one of Ferarchieâ€™s baby sons, and name it Jinx. Then they escape the mountain and find Paradon, a wizard. At this time Kira's brother Dane and his best friend Shanks-Spar are being trained to become dragon knights and go to war. However when Kira's father attacks Lord Dorcan and is killed Dane is imprisoned in his place. With help from Shanks Dane escapes and the two boys, along with their dragons Harmony and Rexor go to Paradon's castle and join the rest of Dane's family. They take shelter in his castle, until Lord Dorcon finds them. Then Paradon casts a spell to send them away from danger. At the end of the book he realises something horrible and says "What have I done?!"
