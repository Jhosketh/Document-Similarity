Now open the covers and join the Doctor in an adventure through Time and Space ... *This story takes place in the mid-21st Century and at the time it was published it was assumed that it featured the K-9 model that was featured in K-9 and Company and The Five Doctors. However, the events of the 2006 episode School Reunion, in which that version of K-9 was destroyed, suggest that the version of K-9 encountered by the Doctor is actually K-9 Mark IV and the model featured in The Sarah Jane Adventures although as far as the Sixth Doctor is concerned, it's the same one he gave Sarah Jane initially. *Drax returns who was first featured in The Armageddon Factor. *The story marks as the latest in chronology in which Omega appears.
