 The central character is a Siberian native, which has been prisoner in a Gulag who speaks a language that has almost disappeared, one that keeps the last vestige of a vanished sound, the lateral fricative with labiovelar appendix. A Russian studious gets to understand him and wants to show him to a congress on Uralic languages in Helsinki. However, a purist Finnish professor attempts to prevent the innocent Siberian appearance as a living proof of the philological connection between the Finnish language and the American natives. The plot is complicated by a Lapon pimp, country cottages with sauna, vacation boats in the Baltic Sea, and sometimes the narration takes a rowdy tone with reminiscences of Wilt by Tom Sharpe. ca:L'últim dels vostiacs (novel·la) it:L'ultimo dei Vostiachi (eng: The Last of the Vostyachs)
