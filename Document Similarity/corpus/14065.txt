 Skynet, the most advanced artificial intelligence ever developed, has long since outstripped its human creators in deviousness, duplicity, and sheer ruthlessness. In 2029, as the human Resistance inexorably pushes toward a victory over the machines, Skynet has a card to play that the Resistance can’t counter. It can use one of the Resistance to betray all humanity. Skynet kidnaps Resistance agent Paul Keeley, drugs him into a hazy, receptive state, and subjects him to an uncannily realistic VR simulation in which a beautiful woman is trying to rescue him from the living hell of the future. Unfortunately, that woman is a seductive, deadly Terminatrix. If Paul believes what his virtual “savior” tells him, he may inadvertently reveal vital Resistance secrets that could cause mankind’s destruction. The Resistance must find the key to unlock Paul’s memory and hunt down the answers that will defeat the Terminatrix, the T-X, Skynet’s most powerful weapon of all.
