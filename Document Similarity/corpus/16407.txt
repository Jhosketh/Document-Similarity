 Goshawk Squadron follows a front-line squadron of British pilots late in the war. The commanding officer is Stanley Woolley, a cold, cruel and sour taskmaster, training the squadron with brutality. The years of war and slaughter had hardened Woolley into a humorless cynic. Woolley especially hates the delusions that replacements have about air combat being gallant and chivalrous. Woolley keeps no emotional attachments, even to his girlfriend Margery, a nurse in the Hospital Corps. The Germans launch their final massive offensive, which leads to a relentless bloodbath. The squadron gets decimated in the endless grind of combat. When Margery's field station gets bombed, she is erroneously reported dead. Realizing how much he did love her, this shatters Woolley, who is incredibly relieved when she appears unharmed. However, Woolley's unemotional focus is stripped away by this close call. Distracted by the thought of Margery and the life they could have together, Woolley is killed leading the next combat patrol.
