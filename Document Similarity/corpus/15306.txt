 The book consists of humorous essays written by Chelsea about her various life experiences. The essays are often blatantly vulgar, much like the ones in Handler's previous two published books. The vulgarity of the stories have in some cases become a point of controversy among parts of the public, however, her fans argue that her straight-forwardness and brutal honesty contribute to the book's appeal.
