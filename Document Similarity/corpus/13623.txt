 The book covers Miller’s interest in cars, which led him into the world of motor racing, beginning during the Great Depression. As Miller’s journey takes him through the eras of segregation, the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, and women’s rights, he manages to start driving as a drag racer, finding sanctuary and fair competition in a pure sports environment. Miller develops a team named Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR), which fields African American second-generation driver Benny Scott. The team endures corporate sponsorship rejection, due to prejudices and disbelief that a black team could be competitive in auto racing. After securing sponsorship from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, BAR enters Formula Super Vee and Formula 5000 races on America’s road racing circuits. The team makes it to the Long Beach Grand Prix in the mid-1970s. Nevertheless, after two years, Brown & Williamson ends its sponsorship programs around the world in auto racing, and BAR is unable to replace the sponsorship. This leads Miller to field a team independently with African American driver Tommy Thompson, who lost his life in a race in 1978. Subsequently, Miller has continued to field teams in NASCAR. Challenges similar to those he faced during the civil rights eras have continued to resurface, and Miller describes these in the book. The story's uniqueness lies in the social challenges Miller encounters that directly affects events on the actual racetrack. He also weaves in intriguing references to his contact with the CIA, his service in the United States Army, aviation, motion pictures, celebrities, and sports icons. Leonard W. Miller was inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame, along with driver Benny Scott, in 1976.
