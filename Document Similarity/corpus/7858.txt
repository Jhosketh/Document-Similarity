 The story starts off with Alex Rider at Brookland School, where he gives a speech about his family, but not much of it, claiming he didn't know his parents, since they died when he was small. He currently lives with his Uncle, Ian Rider, but he's rarely at home either. Mostly, Alex lives with his best friend, Jack Starbright, who is also a housekeeper, there for Alex while Ian is always away on business. Alex also makes a claim that his uncle is a bank supervisor and is in charge of customer care, currently at a conference in Cornwall, unaware that Ian's true occupation is a spy, working for the Special Operations Division of MI6. After the school day is over, and after having a talk with Sabina Pleasure about going out on the weekend, Alex's uncle rings Alex and after they engage in a short, simple conversation about how things are, a helicopter approaches the Rider car, and one of the antagonists of the story, Yassen Gregorovich, shoots Ian to death while hanging from the chopper. From there on, the novel follows the plot and scenes of the Stormbreaker movie plot, though some scenes are shortened or excised. Some scenes were also altered slightly, including the dematerializing of a fish in the jellyfish tank (it was a barracuda in the graphic novel, but a jellyfish in the film).
