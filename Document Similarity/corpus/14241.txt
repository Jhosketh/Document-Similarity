 The story starts in a laboratory at Imperial College, London. Professor Vassily Baraban had developed an unknown, new type of weapon. He could barely settle down when two criminal/assassins, Sergei and Vladimir, ambush him. They demand for the professor to come with them. When Baraban refuses, they shoot him with electric bullets, rendering him unconscious, and take him away. In West London, 98 hours after the kidnapping, Will Knight--a 14-year-old boy and inventor of several cutting-edge gadgets--wakes up early to test his new invention. He arrives at a school, in which he successfully tests the ascension-speeding gadget. He then gives it the name "Rapid ascent". Gaia--a 14-year-old girl, witnesses Will testing his invention, and tells her friend, 14-year-old millionare Andrew. Will is then recruited for STORM. Meanwhile, Vassily Baraban sends an email to his son through the Faraday Cage he is trapped in.
