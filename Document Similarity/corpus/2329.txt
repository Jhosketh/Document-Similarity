 With the help of his latest girlfriend Flicka von Gr√ºsse, James goes after billionaire Sir Maxwell Tarn, who thinks he's the next Hitler. Captain Bond now works for MicroGlobe One rather than an ill M whom he visits to cheer up and keep informed of the plot. The global trail takes 007 to Puerto Rico via Spain, Israel and Germany. During the story, Bond proposes to Flicka. An old friend reappears to aid James and split up this spy twosome.
