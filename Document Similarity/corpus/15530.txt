 Changeless is set in an alternate history version of Victorian England where werewolves and vampires are accepted as functioning members of society. Alexia Tarabotti still has no soul but she does now have a husband. Now known as Lady Maccon, Alexia finds her werewolf husband in distress. His sudden disappearance entangles her with a regiment of supernatural soldiers, a group of exorcised ghosts, and Queen Victoria herself. Alexia uses her sharp tongue, keen mind, and her trusty parasol in her effort to solve the problems put before her and to locate Lord Maccon. Her search takes her to Scotland and a werewolf pack where the fact that she is "soulless", and thus unaffected by the powers of supernatural beings, can make all the difference. *2010, USA, Orbit Books ISBN 0-316-07414-4, Pub date 1 April 2010, Paperback *2010, UK, Orbit Books ISBN 1-84149-974-9, Pub date 2 September 2010, Paperback *2011, Germany, Blanvalet ISBN 978-3-442-37650-6, Pub date 18 July 2011, Paperback (in German as Brennende Finsternis ("Burning Darkness") translated by Anita Nirschl) The author's official website also lists a French language edition by Orbit France/Calmann Levy, a Spanish language edition to be released by Vers√°til, plus an Italian language edition by Baldini & Castoldi, all with "unknown" upcoming publication dates.
