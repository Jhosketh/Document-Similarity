 Nadira, the protagonist, and Aisha are sisters who are total opposites: Nadira is lazy, plump, and an average kid while Aisha is skinny, active, popular, and smart. The family are from Bangladesh and are illegal immigrants in the United States. They have been living for years in New York City on expired visas. With the changed atmosphere after the September 11th attacks, they try to move to Canada but are stopped at the border. Abba (their father) has been sent to INS Detention Center. Their mother, who they call Ma, has been put into a shelter until their father gets out of detention. The girls have to live with relatives in Queens, while waiting for the situation to be resolved.
