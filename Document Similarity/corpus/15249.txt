 In Kingdom Keepers III: Disney In Shadow, the Overtakers’ leaders Maleficent and Chernabog have captured the D.H.I.s’ advisor, Wayne. The teens have reason to believe that the Overtakers have headed to Epcot, so they re-program themselves to automatically cross-over into Epcot instead of the Magic Kingdom when they go to sleep. There, they find that they aren’t the only ones who have free rein in the park—it’s being constantly patrolled by worker bee Overtakers such as the snake from Honey, I Shrunk the Audience and the car dummies from Test Track, throwing a wrench into the D.H.I.s’ already-complicated mission. To add another layer of complexity to the situation, the subtitle Disney In Shadow refers to areas where the D.H.I. teens aren’t programmed to be visible, which sometimes gives them an edge over the Overtakers but occasionally works to their disadvantage.
