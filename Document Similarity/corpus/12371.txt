 On one of those rare days when all is quiet at the Quai des Orf√®vres Maigret receives a visit from the mild-mannered toy salesman (at the Magasins du Louvre) Xavier Marton. Marton thinks that either his wife is trying to poison him or he is just crazy. Then Mme. Marton also shows up leaving Maigret rather bemused. Worried about his own wife's health and musing over his marriage, Maigret decides to investigate despite an order from the public prosecutor not to. When a body finally shows up, the reality is a surprise to everyone.
