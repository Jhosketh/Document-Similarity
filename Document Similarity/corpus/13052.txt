 In 1939, a ten-year old girl named Juanita Wagner was the pen pal of Anne Frank and she only sent two letters. Juanita lived in Danville, Iowa. Juanita and her older sister, Betty (the pen pal of Margot), wondered what had happened to the Franks in the war. After the production of a 1955 Broadway show called The Diary of Anne Frank on Broadway the sisters realized who their pen pals were. The book tells the story of Anne Frank's life and Juanita Wagner's life.
