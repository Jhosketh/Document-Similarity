 Troy Billings, 6'1 and weighing 296 pounds, is standing on the edge of a subway platform contemplating suicide when a homeless former student from Troy's school, Curt McCrae, intervenes. Curt tells Troy that he saved his life, now he owes him a favor, so he insists that they start a band together with Troy playing drums. The only problem is that Troy can't play drums and hasn't since seventh grade. Together, Curt and Troy create the band Rage/Tectonic. Although unable to play drums, he goes right into practicing for an upcoming gig. In the process, Troy finds self-confidence and acceptance while realizing he is desperately trying to save Curt's life from drug addiction and abuse.
