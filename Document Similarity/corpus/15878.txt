 Accurately following the campaigns of the 17th Regiment of Foot in the American colonies, the company Snow enlists into finds itself at odds with their own ranks as much as those of the enemies, as the seven men enlist together each becomes at odds with their nemesis Sergeant Matthias Skinner who seems hell bent upon their destruction. The novel climaxes at the Battle of Princeton in January 1777 with the famous bayonet charge made by the 17th Regiment as Lt Colonel Charles Mawhoods British brigade is surrounded by General George Washington's army.
