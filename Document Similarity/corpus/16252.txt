 The main story begins in 1937 when brothers Wilfred and Duncan Scrutton run away from their home at Ferring near Worthing on the Sussex coast and travel to London. Wilfred the narrator recounts how they had seen an advert in the Daily Mail which said 'Trams surplus to the requirements of the London Omnibus and Tramcar Company for sale at their depot at Acton, London for Â£2 each.' They pool their resources and travel to the depot where they are told that trams were indeed for sale but had to be collected and could not be delivered to Sussex. The only candidate was an old horse-drawn tram and they manage to secure a horse called Homer from a retired rag and bone man. Unfortunately the depot had no destination boards for Sussex but they had one for Canterbury for which they set off via the Old Kent Road accompanied by Homer's companion - a dog called Tiger. They gained fare-paying passengers at Harbledown and began a regular if slow service between there and Canterbury, and also acquire a conductor called Hattie. Rival companies eventually force them to move on due to the lack of a PSV operators license and they travel back to Worthing where they gain the support of the wealthy resident of Goring Hall who inspired by their determination funds the purchase and transport of an electric tram from Acton which they renovate and put into service in Worthing town centre. The second half of the novel concerns events during World War II, the brothers volunteering for both the LDV and ARP and Hattie for the VAD.
