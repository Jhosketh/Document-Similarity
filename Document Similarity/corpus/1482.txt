 Wimschneider tells of the hard conditions in which she grew up, on a farm. In 1927, at the age of 8, after her mother's death, she had to look after her family of 9. She later married Albert Wimschneider, but he was then conscripted and went off to war, leaving Anna to look after their farm, together with her mother-in-law.
