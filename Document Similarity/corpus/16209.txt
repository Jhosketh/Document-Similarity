 The story starts at Gatwick Airport in London, where Manda, Chell, Kylah, Finn, Kay and Ava have met to go on a joint holiday. They have not yet agreed upon a destination, planning to do so at the airport before booking a low-cost last-minute deal. This plan is hindered when it becomes apparent that Manda has lost her passport, and much of the narrative takes place in the airport lounges and bars that the group are confined to for several days. The main themes explored through the characters' interactions are social class and friendship.
