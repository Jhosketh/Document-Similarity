 Paul has moved to Miami with his mother Laura, 47 years old. They moved there, to a small apartment, following his parents' divorce. Paul's father has a new family now, and his name is Greg. Paul attends a new school where his mother is a secretary. Paul must suffer as a social outcast in the rich kid's private school Gate. Coming in as a sophomore, he is branded as a loser. Though the life of a social outcast is a perilous, tough life, he meets one friend: Belinda (Binky) Lopez-Nande. She is similar to him in the social tree: a lowly outcast. The two manage to live, but just barely. Meanwhile, the fact that his father left him with his mother still stings, and while he never returns his calls, Paul persists in trying. Then, on one miraculous day, the popular, star athlete rich kids, led by the famous Charlie Good, invite him on a mailbox bash. Charlie and his followers, Gray St. John and Randy Meade (St. John and Meat) allow Paul a shot at joining them. Paul agrees and goes with them, and though he respects his neighbors, he decides to bash some boxes. The next day, at school Paul waves to Charlie, but receives nothing in return. Charlie continues to ask Paul to do worse and worse things in order to retain his friendship, leading to the dramatic conclusion - bombing the school.
