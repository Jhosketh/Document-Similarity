 In the Wedded Bliss, the author mainly puts the focus on his wife Chen Yun as showing his sorrow to beauty. Chen Yun’s is not so beautiful, but she pursues beauty by nature. She takes painting and embroidering as a necessity to composing poem and regards the simple life as the ideal situation. Shen Fu treats her like a close friend who can share with his hobbies and feelings, but the idea is not recognized by the orthodox society, which only remains as the author’s yearning for beauty. The Little Pleasures of Life gives a vivid description of the leisure time activities of Shen Fu: his joys of his childhood, his adult life cultivating flowers, and the experiences of composing poems with other scholars. He tends to be close to nature in childhood and takes delight in nature. While in the adulthood, he has very little time to focus on nature, and is often chained to worldly possessions. Many of the episodes are involved with discussions of aesthetic experiences, which are really worthy of careful thinking. In Sorrow, Shen Fu points out that most of his life frustrations are out of his uprightness and his commitment to words. Though this chapter opens with the author’s own sorrow, actually its large content deals with the bumpy life of Chen Yun which is also due her characters. The content is full of the author’s endless love for his wife and resentment to the unfaire fate. The Joys of Travel not only portrays beautiful scenic spots the author had visited but also records anecdotes, local customs and historical allusions. Different from others, the author holds the belif that the gaining of experience counts rather than having a rough view and following what others said.
