 The memoir is a non-fiction account of the events surrounding the eventual demotion of Pluto from full-planetary status. It chronicles the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet even larger than Pluto, located within the Kuiper belt, beyond Neptune's orbit. The replaying of events include the adversarial challenging of long-held scientific beliefs between some of the world's leading astronomers, and the eventual 2006 International Astronomical Union's vote to demote Pluto from the nine planets of the Solar System.
