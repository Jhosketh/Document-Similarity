 The novel details the Jose León Suárez massacre, which involved the 1956 capture and shooting of Peronist militants, including rebel leader Juan José Valle. These events followed a 1955 military coup, known as the Revolución Libertadora, which deposed Argentine president Juan Perón and eventually brought the hard-line general Pedro Eugenio Aramburu to power.
