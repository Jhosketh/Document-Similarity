 The main protagonist, Kyle Nathaniel Harper, is a senior in high school, fairly vapid on the surface, but intuitive to the evilness in his surroundings. As he and the town prepare for the fall festivities, which include four nights of "The Haunted Woods," Kyle starts to be introduced to the true nature of his parents, friends, and the rest of the town. Set up as a frame-narrative, the story moves back and forth from nightmare sequence to actual reality, which is meant to throw the reader off as well develop questions about the inner psyche of the main character. Kyle and his friends have the same qualities as well as insecurities of normal teenagers, but when Kyle finds out that it's not only his father's adultery that caused his parents to divorce, he begins to be haunted with thoughts of becoming a monster or dying a victim.
