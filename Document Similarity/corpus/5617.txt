 The plot revolves around the behaviour of a 12-year-old boy called Marius Stern, who is suspended from his boarding school for hitting another boy. Scientist Ptolemaeos Tunne, with the assistance of Jeremy Morrison, attempt to get to the bottom of Marius' behaviour. Marius has a crush on Jeremy and persuades him to share his bed, though nothing sexual happens.
