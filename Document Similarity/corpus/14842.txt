 Behemoth continues an alternate history story begun in Leviathan. It is 1914, and the Darwinist countries of Britain, France, and Russia are on the brink of world war with the Clanker countries of Germany and Austria-Hungary. War has been declared, although the Ottoman Empire has not yet entered. The Darwinists use technology based on genetically manipulated animals, while the Clankers use machinery.
