 Song of Lawino, which is a narrative poem, describes how Lawino's husband, Ocol, who is the son of the tribal leader of their specific Acoli tribe, has taken a new wife, Clementine. Although Ocol's polygamy is accepted by society, and by Lawino herself, it is apparent from his actions (as described by Lawino) that he is shunning her in favor of his new wife. Ocol is also said to have a fascination with the culture of the white colonialists, as does Clementine. As an example of this, Lawino says Ocol no longer engages, or has any interest in, the ritualistic African dance but prefer the ballroom style dances introduced by the colonising Europeans. This loss of culture on the part of Ocol is what disturbs Lawino the most. The poem is an extended appeal from Lawino to Ocol to stay true to his own customs, and to abandon his desire to be white.The book also castigates the treatment of christianity by pagans and advocates for the african culture which has been lost by the educated elite.Lawino bemourns her husband's lack of african pride and she goes on to romanticize about all that is black.This is illustrated widely in the text as the african woman Lawino appreciates the fact that "all that is black is beautiful."However it should be noted with great concern that Ocol becomes sentimental about the african culture alone and paints the western culture with a black brush.
