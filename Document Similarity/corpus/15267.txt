 It is set around the time of Attila the Hun, and part of it is based on the Byzantine diplomat Priscus' account of his visit to Attila's court. The narrator and hero of the novel is a young Byzantine freedman of Priscus nicknamed Zeta who travels with him to Attila. He falls in love with Emmo, the daughter of a Hunnish nobleman (a "princess lointaine" figure). He commits himself to slavery among the Huns in the hope of eventually marrying her, to some extent going native among them. It includes dramatic accounts of the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains between the Huns and the Romans, and the funeral of Attila.
