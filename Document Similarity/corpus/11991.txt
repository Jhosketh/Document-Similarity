 Skinny is about two sisters, 22-year old medical student Giselle and 14-year old track star Holly. Giselle suffers from anorexia possibly linked to the love-deprived relationship with her father, who has been dead for nine years and had always favoured Holly. The story is told from the perspective of both girls.
