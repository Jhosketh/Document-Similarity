 Darrell is on the way to Malory Towers once again. On the way they pick up a new girl called Zerelda, who is from the USA. Once they arrive, they see the Bad One, Gwen, making a Fond Farewell with her mother and governess. Suddenly Gwen sees Zerelda and immediately loses her heart to her. The ever-so malicous Alicia notices it and points it out to Darrell. It is then revealed that not only is Zerelda in North Tower but in the Fourth Form. A few days later, the final new girl arrives: Bill Robinson. Bill is short for Wilhelmina, who in turn has truckloads of horses and 7 brothers. She arrives with the brothers and her horse. The brothers and their horses leave leaving Bill to take her horse, Thunder, to the stables. A few weeks later, Zerelda is so remarkably stupid that she is put down in the third form. The next surprise is that Darrell is a reserve for one of the Malory Towers Lacrosse teams. Next up on the event roster is Zerelda gets a tremendous scolding from Ms Hibbert. And all is well until....... After Zerelda gets a misunderstood scolding from Miss Hibbert, a few weeks later the biggie happens: Thunder (Bill's horse) suffers from colic while Darrell and Bill work all night in the rain to stop him lying down and Ms Peters rides for miles in the pouring rain to get the vet and accidentally save the life of the to-be Conceited Opera Singer Mavis Allyson who loses her voice as a consequence). Then everything is right again and the end of term looms.
