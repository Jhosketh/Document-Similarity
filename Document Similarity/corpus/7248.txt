 Hairstyles of the Damned is told by a typical protagonist, Brian Oswald. Brian Oswald is an average high school outcast. He has trouble coping with his identity and fights to find it throughout the novel. Even though Brian is an outcast at his Catholic school, he still manages to find friends in a mix of misfits. Gretchen is a tough, punk girls who makes Brian mixed tapes. Brian envies Gretchen because she does whatever she wants. "She did the things I wish I could do but didn't have the guts to" (Meno 15). He is infatuated with her, but she is interested in losers. Brian’s other friends include Rod, an African American nerd who had the largest record collection of anyone Brian knew. Mike is a burn out whose long hair was more popular than he was at school. Brian's family was a bit dysfunctional. His father begins sleeping in the basement and when Brian questions his father, he plays it off like it is no big deal. Joe Meno captures the meaning of adolescence and all that goes along with it such as awkwardness, finding your identity, first crushes, puberty, and the constant power struggle between parents and teens. There is a common theme throughout the novel that ties Brian's identity all together and that is music. Brian switches his choice of music throughout the story. He starts off liking Gretchen’s punk music, then to Rod's Chet Baker Albums, to Mike's Pink Floyd tapes. Brian changes who he is, depending of the music he is listening to. He is so worried about fitting in instead of having his own voice and accepting who he is. Brian does grow and develop over the course of the novel; his identity develops as well does his outlook on life. By the end of the novel Brian realizes it is okay to just be yourself.
