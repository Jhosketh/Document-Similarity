 Michael Stewart is a single dad in modern-day New York struggling to raise his feisty 13 year-old daughter, Elizabeth. Feeling beaten down by life, he shuts out new relationships but fate, or perhaps something more divine, has other plans. When they stumble upon a root-cellar door in a church basement, they discover a portal leading back to first-century Jerusalem during the tumultuous last week of Christâ€™s life. There they encounter Leah, a grieving widow, and a menacing soldier, determined to take Elizabeth as his own. Trapped in the past - both literally and figuratively - Michael comes face to face with some of his most limiting beliefs, and realizes he must open himself up to the possibility of a deeper faith in God, people, himself, and love if he is to find his way home.
