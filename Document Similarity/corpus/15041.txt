 In ancient China's Northern Song Dynasty, Bao Zheng rises from humble beginnings to high office at the imperial court, gathering around him a group of Robin Hood-type men to fight crime and corruption. Using their exceptional fighting talents, the seven heroes and five gallants rescue maidens in distress, succor the old and weak, kill evildoers, and bring corrupt officials before Justice Bao. When the Prince of Xiangyang plots rebellion, the brave men set out to foil his plans.
