 Set in the Melbourne property industry, SOLD provides an insight into the inner machinations of one real estate agency. It is based around three real estate agents and their dealings as they scheme and deceive to outdo one another and struggle to ultimately come out on top. Will Pittman, a former (and failed) AFL Sydney Swan footballer, is new to the business and struggling to keep his head above the water. He is mentored by Harry "The Fox" Osborne, an ex-car dealer from New Zealand in real estate to pay his kids school fees. New to the agency too, is Dally Love, the conquering hero who wants and has it all. Morally bankrupt, this world of intricacy pulls these characters into its web of chaos. Also there is Gerard, mentally disabled, easily influenced and somewhat destructive - friend of Will and squatting in the convent marked by Dally for development.
