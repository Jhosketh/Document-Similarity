 Nyora Tentay (the term senyora is the Filipino word for the Spanish term se√±ora, meaning "Mrs."; nyora is the abbreviated form of senyora) is the matriarch of the wealthy Marcial family, and is labelled the "queen of Canal de la Reina". She is a money lender who charges high interest rates. She has a son, Victor, who is married to Gracia; Victor and Gracia have a son, Gerry. Salvador and Caridad De los Angeles are husband and wife; their children are Leni and Junior. Gerry Marcial and Leni de los Angeles are lovers. Nyora Tentay buys a piece of land from the De los Angeles' former caretaker, Precioso or Osyong Santos. The land belongs to the De los Angeles family; Nyora uses bribery to assert her claim. A flood occurs at Canal de la Reina, which damages buildings and structures. Caridad finds documents belonging to Nyora Tentay, and returns them instead of using them against her. This gesture of goodwill causes Nyora to have a change of heart. Gerry Marcial and Leni de los Angeles marry.
