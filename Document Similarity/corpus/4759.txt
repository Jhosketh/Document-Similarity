 This adventure takes place in modern France and uses the normal continuing storyline of the series. Lapinot and Nadia are still working together (see the previous volume Pour de vrai), this time doing radio interviews. Things don't always go smoothly and work-related arguments lead to tensions in their couple. They most notably meet with a group of radicals with originally noble goals but questionable methods. At the same time, Richard becomes convinced his neighbour is an alien.
