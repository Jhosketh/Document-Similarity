 This is an approximate summary of the content of the Freiheitsschrift using page numbering as appears in Schelling's Works. There is no division except into paragraphs. *336-8 There is a traditional view that system excludes individual freedom; but on the contrary it does have "a place in the universe". This is a problem to solve. *338-343 Reformulation as the issue of pantheism and fatalism. *343-8 Spinoza and Leibniz. *348 German idealism versus French atheistic mechanism; Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre. *349-352 It is a mistake to believe that idealism has simply displaced pantheism. *352-355 The real conception of freedom is the possibility of good and evil. *356-357 Critique of the abstract conception of God; Naturphilosophie. *357-358 Ground of God and light. *359-366 Critique of immanence. *366-373 Conception of evil according to Baader. *373-376 Evil is necessary for God's revelation; exegesis of "matter" in Plato. *376-7 The irrational element in organic beings; disjunction of light and darkness. *379 Golden Age. *382-3 Formal conception of freedom; Buridan's Ass. *383 Idealism defines freedom. *385 Man's being is his own deed. *387 Predestination. *389-394 General possibility of evil and inversion of selfhood's place. *394 God's freedom. *396 Leibniz on laws of nature. *399 God is not a system, but a life; finite life in man. *402 God brought forward order from chaos. *403 History is incomprehensible without a concept of a humanly suffering God. *406 Primal ground (Ungrund) is before all antitheses; groundlessness self-divides. *409 Evil is a parody. *412 Revelation and reason. *413 Paganism and Christianity. *413 Personality rests on a dark foundation, which is also the foundation of knowledge. *414 Dialectical philosophy. *415 Historical foundation of philosophy. *416 Nature as revelation, and its archetypes. Promise of further treatises.
