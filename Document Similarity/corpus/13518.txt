 Pyramid of Shadows presents an adventure wherein players find their way to a multi-levelled extradimensional pyramid built by the gods as a prison for the power-mad Tiefling wizard Karavakos. Karavakos' power - and personality - has been fractured into multiple parts in order to keep him bound within the prison. In a plot to obtain his freedom, Karavakos tricks players into hunting down and killing several splinter versions of himself within the pyramid, in order that Karavakos might regain the power they hold and break free of the prison. However with the aid of the undying head of Karavakos' one time Eladrin lover Vyrellis, the players gain the opportunity to breach Karavakos' sanctum and defeat the wizard, which dissolves the pyramid and frees the players.
