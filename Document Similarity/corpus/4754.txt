 This adventure takes place in modern France and uses the normal continuing storyline of the series. While walking on the street, Lapinot and Richard accidentally bump into a bum about to commit suicide. They prevent him from doing so despite his repeated attempts, and he eventually accepts to stop trying to kill himself as long as they accept to take his little stone which, according to him, is cursed and brings terrible bad luck to the bearer. Lapinot accepts, not taking him seriously, but most other characters around him seem to be plagued with bad luck from that moment on. Up until the end of the book, it isn't clear whether there is a real curse or if it all happens in the characters' minds.
