 The Blue Equinox opens with Crowley's poem "Hymn to Pan", a devotional work devoted to the ancient Greek deity Pan. This is followed by an editorial, in which Crowley discusses Thelema, the A∴A∴ and the O.T.O., and the important role which he believed that they had to play in the Aeon of Horus. #Editorial #Præmonstrance of A∴A∴ #Curriculum of A∴A∴ #Liber II [The Message of the Master Therion] #The Tent #Liber DCCCXXXVII [The Law of Liberty] #Liber LXI [vel Causae A∴A∴] #A Psalm #Liber LXV [Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente] #Liber CL [De Lege Libellum] #A Psalm #Liber CLXV [A Master of the Temple] #Liber CCC [Khabs am Pekht] #Stepping Out of the Old Aeon into the New #The Seven Fold Sacrament #Liber LII [Manifesto of the O.T.O.] #Liber CI [An Open Letter to Those Who May Wish to Join the Order] #Liber CLXI [Concerning the Law of Thelema] #Liber CXCIV [An Intimation with Reference to the Constitution of the Order] #Liber XV (The Gnostic Mass) #Nekam Adonai! #A La Loge #The Tank *Special Supplement: Liber LXXI [The Voice of the Silence: The Two Paths, The Seven Portals]
