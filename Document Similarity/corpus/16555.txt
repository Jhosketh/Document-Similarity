 Prue McKeel, having rescued her brother from the Dowager Governess at the conclusion of the first novel, returns to her normal daily life of school and daydreaming. She finds her mind drifting back to Wildwood as she becomes increasingly bored with her studies. Meanwhile, dark events are transpiring in the Impassable Wilderness. A long, cold winter coupled with political discord fueled by an organization calling itself the "Bicycle Coup" have put Wildwood's residents on edge. Assassins are lurking in the forest's shadows, their intentions and motives unknown, while an industrial tyrant plots to exploit the natural resources of this magical world. With Wildwood once again under threat by dark forces, Prue returns to the Impassable Wilderness and teams up with her friend Curtis to bring unity to a land once again divided by conflict. This time though, they'll have to journey into the mysterious caverns and tunnels beneath the Impassable Wilderness.
