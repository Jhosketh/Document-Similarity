He occasionally insults Rogelio, and Tessa, designer of Rogelio's suit. Though she is blind, she is quite talented and intelligent, and Rogelio cares for her. As the story progresses, Rogelio learns how to control his ability, and he then decides to become a hero. He was given the nickname "Kapitan Sino" by the people. He soon discovers the town Mayor's secret, and Rogelio defeats his son, who had become a giant worm-like monster which lives off human blood. Tessa is the monster's final victim, and after her death, Rogelio slowly begins to lose all reason to continue in becoming a hero. After the said event, an epidemic spreads, and everyone becomes desperate to find a cure. Rogelio, blamed for a crime he did not commit, is caught and imprisoned, along with his friend Bok-bok. Medics discover that Rogelio's blood may be a cure for the mysterious virus. In the end, Rogelio saves the people by donating his blood. They had tents outside the Church of Pelaez, where they had their medical mission, but things got out of control, so they decided to get some of Rogelio's blood in the Church. He was able to stand and walk out of the Church, looking for his parents, still not fully recovered from the blood donation. Outside, a man carrying a child asked him if his blood was the cure. The man stabbed him, and he fell to the ground, the man dipping his hand unto Rogelio's wound. After his death, Pelaez becomes peaceful, and Rogelio is given a commemoration.
