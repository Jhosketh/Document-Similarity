 Axel Vander, famous man of letters and recently widowed, travels to Turin to meet a young woman called Cass Cleave. Cleave is a literary researcher and she has unearthed two secrets about Vander's early years in Antwerp, the first being that in the years prior to World War Two Vander contributed some anti-Semitic articles to a right-wing newspaper, and secondly, that he is not Axel Vander at all. He is Vander's childhood friend and appropriated his name and identity after Vander disappeared and was presumed dead.
