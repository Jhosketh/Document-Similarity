 The plot follows Murray Douglas as he joins a theatre production with a group of dysfunctional actors. The play is an avant-garde one where the actors make up the script during rehearsal, and rehearsals take place in an isolated country house. It emerges that the author is feeding each participant's vices, in service of the prurient interests of decadent time travellers.
