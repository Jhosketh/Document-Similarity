No one, not even Theo—who knows April better than anyone—has any idea of what has happened. As fear ripples through his small hometown, the police continue to hit dead-ends. The police think it could be a distant cousin of April, Jack Leeper, who escaped from prison at the same time as April went missing. It is up to Theo to use his legal knowledge and investigative skills to chase down the truth and save April.
