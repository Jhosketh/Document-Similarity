 Following the second instalment of the series, The Vice Society, Inspector Albert Newsome of the Metropolitan Police’s Detective Force has been temporarily demoted to the Thames River Police for his insubordination. He can retain his old position only if he proves himself with good behaviour. Meanwhile, his old enemy George Williamson is working as a private detective at the theatres of London, where his job is to catch pickpockets. Both men are highly suspicious of a new face in London: Eldritch Batchem, who claims to be an investigator “By Royal Appointment”. When an outrageous theft is made from the city’s docks, a competition then begins to see who will be the first to solve the crime, with consequences that none of them could have expected.
