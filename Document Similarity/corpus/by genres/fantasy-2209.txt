 At the beginning, we see that the cats of the Dark Forest are training Breezepelt and other cats in the same way they trained Lionblaze. Hawkfrost begins to visit Ivypaw in her dreams and teaches her many battle moves, pretending he is from StarClan. Ivypaw, still jealous that Dovepaw is keeping secrets from her own kin, decides not to tell anyone about Hawkfrost's training. Leopardstar, leader of RiverClan, loses her last life, and Mistyfoot takes her place as leader of RiverClan. The three reveal to Firestar who they are; Firestar reveals that he suspected it all along, but had his doubts after Hollyleaf's death. Firestar tells the Three what he knows about them, and delivers a crucial piece of information: The prophecy is not from StarClan. After days of rain, Dovepaw senses a tree on the edge of the hollow about to fall. She warns Firestar and the Clan, and they manage to evacuate the camp before the tree falls. However, Mousefur stays behind, refusing to give up on a mouse that she was eating. Longtail goes back for the mouse, and Briarpaw goes back for Longtail. As a result, Briarpaw's hind legs are paralyzed, and Longtail is killed. With Leafpool's help, Jayfeather finds out that Littlecloud had the same problem with another cat. The cat's lack of exercise allowed a chest infection to make it harder for him to breathe, eventually killing him. Jayfeather vows not to let Briarpaw die, but near the end of the book Briarpaw starts to develop a perhaps deadly cough. Briarpaw, Bumblepaw, and Blossompaw get their warrior names: Briarlight, Blossomfall, and Bumblestripe. Tigerstar tells Ivypaw that giving a strip of land to ShadowClan has endangered ThunderClan. Ivypaw believes Tigerstar and tells Firestar that she had a dream from StarClan of ShadowClan invading, because they believe that Firestar is too weak to keep his own territory. Firestar and the senior warriors decide to attack ShadowClan before they can attack ThunderClan. During the battle Lionblaze kills Russetfur, but not before she deprives Firestar of his seventh life. Lionblaze then looks upon the misery and death that the battle has brought, and believes that it should have never occurred.
