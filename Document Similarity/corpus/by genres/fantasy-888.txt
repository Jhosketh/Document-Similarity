 The book is written by nineteenth century author, dragonologist Dr. Ernest Drake purporting to have written the material in ink (needs clarification on what it was actually written in) . The subject matters are dragons; where to find them, information about different species, how to work with them and several tactile "samples" of dragon material, including their wings, scales and skin. Also included in the book is a sealed envelope enclosing dragon-calling spells, dragon riddles, a "letter" from Dr. Drake, a number of illustrations, mostly in color, detailing dragons and their anatomy, and a foldout map showing dragon locations throughout the world.
