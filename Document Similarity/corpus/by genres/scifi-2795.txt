 Oliver Vale was conceived on February 3, 1959, the day that Buddy Holly died. Exactly thirty years later, Buddy Holly appears on every television set in the world, on every channel. Holly states that he is being held on Ganymede, and that Oliver Vale is to be contacted for assistance. He then begins performing. As a result, Vale finds himself being pursued by agents of the Federal Communications Commission, by angry television-watchers, and by still more mysterious forces.
