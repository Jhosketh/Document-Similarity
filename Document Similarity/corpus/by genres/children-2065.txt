 Just like previous Field Editions, Battles of the Clans has no real plot but consists of multiple short stories told by cats from the Clans (including SkyClan). Battles of the Clans starts with Ashfoot bringing two kittypets, the readers, into Onestar's den. He welcomes them and brings them to each Clan to find out their special battle tactics. After visiting ThunderClan, ShadowClan, RiverClan, and WindClan, a SkyClan ancestor visits the readers while they are sleeping and tells them their special battle tactic. Tawnypelt then tells the readers of the lake territories and battles. Tigerstar subsequently appears and tells of the forest territories and battles. After this, there is a Gathering, at which the readers hear stories of past battles. Onestar then says goodbye, and the book concludes.
