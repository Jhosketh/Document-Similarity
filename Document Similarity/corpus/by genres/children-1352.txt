 A mole who is just getting out of his hole gets pooped on his head by an unidentified animal; he is certain that it doesn't belong to him and sets out on a mission to discover whom it does belong to. The animals he runs into all poop to show what theirs looks like, and finally the mole receives some assistance from some flies who help him identify whodunit: the butcher's dog. The mole exacts his revenge by pooping on the dog's head, and returns to his hole happily.
