 Vin, after taking the power of the Well of Ascension at the end of the previous book, released it into the world instead of saving Elend. Elend, however, survived by consuming a bead of metal which made him an extremely powerful Mistborn. However, the entirety of the Terrismen prophecies were shown to have been changed by the god, Ruin, in order to trick Vin into freeing it from the Well. Now Ruin has been released and is beginning to destroy the world. The Lord Ruler, in preparation of such an event, created storage caches containing valuables such as food and water in cave complexes beneath certain cities, each one providing directions to the next. As Vin and Elend struggle from cache to cache, looking for the atium stash, the world itself begins to crumble, ash spewing forth in greater quantities and the mists claiming more and more people. Meanwhile, Sazed continues to struggle with his faith, trying and failing to find a religion that makes sense while he, along with Breeze, try to help Elend take over the rebel city Urteau, where Spook has developed strange abilities and started a new revolution. TenSoon, on the other hand, is imprisoned and trying to convince the kandra that the world is ending, and that they must work together with the humans to save the world. As the book progresses, Vin and Elend try to conquer the city of Fadrex City and discover more about how their world works. They discover patterns in the numbers of people dying after being exposed to the mists, as well as secrets regarding the koloss, kandra, and Inquisitors, but fearing that Ruin will discover their plans, are unable to discuss their plans with each other. As the days grow hotter and the mists stronger, Vin and Elend encounter more and more dangers. Yomen, the King of Fadrex City, captures Vin, who escapes and battles with Ruin, who has been fooling them into leading him to his body, which turns out to be the atium stash.
