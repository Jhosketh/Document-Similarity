 Fleeing from a neighbor's assailants, who believe he has identified them to the police, LeRoy leaves his Chicago housing project to live with his grandfather, a shrimp fisherman, in Mississippi. This was Butterworth's last children's book. He also wrote under several pseudonyms, most notably as W.E.B. Griffin.
