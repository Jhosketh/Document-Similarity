 Chuck and David have two further adventures. This volume collects two short stories in the Mushroom Planet series, but is very rarely mentioned. The book was published in 1964 by the American Book Company; it is 64 pages. It was designed as a school reading book, and each story has several discussion questions after it. The stories add more detail about David, Chuck, Mr. Bass, Mr. Brumblydge, etc. In the first, the boys meet a mysterious but kindly old lady (apparently a Mycetian like Mr. Bass) who takes them on a spectacular dream journey. In the second, they accompany Prewytt Brumblydge on an expedition to recover portions of a brumblium meteorite.
