 The book chronicles a year of the life of Laura, a sixteen year old student in London, as England imposes carbon rationing in the wake of weather-related disasters. The stresses of rationing and extreme weather tear at the social fabric of Europe and England, while Laura's family is torn apart as her father loses his job and her selfish older sister refuses to adapt. Laura just wants to live a normal life, attract the attention of the fetching and accomplished boy next door, and practice with her friends in her garage band.
