 The novel first begins with Charles rummaging around looking for his phone. As he gets more and more frustrated being unable to find it, he decides to arrive at work. During an operation involving 'The Clamp', a giant steel plated holding device, Charles notices his phone in the background and -while not paying attention- crushes his leg with it.
