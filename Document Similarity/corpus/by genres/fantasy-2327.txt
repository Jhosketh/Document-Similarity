Traveling in the memory of the Hindenburgh, Mary is spreading her propaganda and attracting Afterlights to her cause at a frightening speed. Meanwhile, together with Mikey, the once teriffying monster McGill, Allie the Outcast travels home to look for her parents.

Allie's body lies in a comatose state waiting for her soul to rejoin it. By the end of the book, The Ripper, Allie, and Nick join forces to defeat the evil Mary Hightower and foil her plan to kill all the world's children in order to bring them into Everlost. The Ripper ends up using her abilities to push Mary into an opening that takes her into the real world. On her way thorugh Mary manages to grab on to her and pull her in with her.
