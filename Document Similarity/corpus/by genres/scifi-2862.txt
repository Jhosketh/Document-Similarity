 Dinosaur Planet featured the survey of planet Ireta for its mineral wealth. Several mysteries unfolded whose resolution was interrupted by a Heavyworlder mutiny. After 43 years, survivors of the mutiny are wakened from cold sleep. Their emergency message has been decoded by a Thek who asks questions but not about the mutiny. They tell him about a buried beacon they found, and he immediately leaves without helping them. Forced to survive on their own, they discover that the mutineers have built a settlement and landing grid that could only be used to colonize a planet -- in this case, illegally. Several Thek arrive and seize control for their own reasons.
