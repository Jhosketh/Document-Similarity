 As in his earlier book Gusher of Lies (which was about the idea of energy independence), Bryce argues that the United States needs to continue to use large amounts of fossil fuels including imported oil. However he does contemplate ways in which reliance on fossil fuels might be reduced: * Energy efficiency: Bryce claims that the United States' record in improving energy efficiency puts it in the top three of the developed countries, but addicted to prosperity. * The use of nuclear power Bryce argues that some renewable sources, such as wind farms, are not truly green and that carbon capture and storage will not work and will prove to be an expensive mistake.
