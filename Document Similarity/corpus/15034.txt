 The semi-autobiographical story is set in a small rural town in Kerala, India. When the story begins, the author is preparing to start his journey from Kollam to join a newly created Engineering college, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam. The author takes us through his experience in the new college, which had no facilities whatsoever, and then goes on to talk about the social and political climate in Kerala during that time. Soon, he introduces us to a girl with whom he later falls in love. The story then takes us through the girl's experience where she is a witness to the murder of a nun - a case very similar to the infamous Sister Abhaya murder case that rocked the state during the same time period as the story's timeline.
