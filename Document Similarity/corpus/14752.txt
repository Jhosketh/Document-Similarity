 Set over a period of four days, the novel explores mental illness through its central character, Professor Martin Sturrock, described as ‘widely viewed as one of the best psychiatrists in the business’, and several of his patients. Among these are an alcoholic politician, a traumatised burns victim, a depressed manual worker, an adulterous barrister turned fitness fanatic and a Kosovan refugee who has been raped. Each patient tells his or her story in a consultation with Sturrock before they are later revisited in their individual subplots. Over the course of a weekend it becomes apparent that the brilliant but overworked Sturrock is as desperate for help as the people he is treating, and following an encounter in a seedy brothel the story ends tragically for the Professor on a busy London street.
