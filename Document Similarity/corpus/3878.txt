 The Bloodstone Wars consists of a Battlesystem scenario depicting a battle to rid a city of a bandit horde. The module is designed for 1st edition AD&D and makes considerable use of some rules that were removed in 2nd edition, notably the assassin character class. There are two main parts of the module, the War itself which includes preparation and fighting out Battlesystem battles, and a small "dungeon" adventure which could occur at several points of the war. While the module provides alternatives for those who do not want to use miniatures to fight out the battles, the Battlesystem scenarios take a considerable portion of the module information. Players without Battlesystem would likely feel they were not getting full value from the module.
