 On the night of the fire, Hughes told her children to put their coats on and wait for her in the car. She then started the fire with gasoline poured around the bed Mickey Hughes was sleeping in. After the house had caught fire, Hughes drove with her (movie - three children) (actually two girls and one boy) to the local police station in order to confess. Hughes was tried in Lansing, Michigan, and found by a jury of her peers to be not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Having turned the book into a made-for-television movie, Goldemberg's screenplay, The Burning Bed, premiered on NBC on October 8, 1984. The movie, directed by Robert Greenwald, starred Farrah Fawcett as Francine Hughes and Paul LeMat as Mickey Hughes. The movie was filmed in Rosharon, Texas. The house that served as the house of Farrah Fawcett's character still stands today.
