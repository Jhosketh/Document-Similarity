 A search for roots, humanity and survival in the gloom of recent Balkan history. Poems are in verse, but also arranged as prose poems. The first section, "A Search for Roots," deals with the politics and cultural landscape of the country, with beautiful portrayals of nature and religious monuments. The second section, "Staring at Infinity," refers to classical archetypes, the battle of Troy and the story of Jesus. The last section, "Naked Life," speaks of the family in the midst of violence, devastation and confusion. Illuminating notes clarify the complex politics of the region and its tortured history. "Bogomil Gjuzel [pronounced Dzyuzel] is the republic's greatest living poet. The publication of these fine translations illustrates how the sense of living in tragic times permeates Gjuzel's work. What makes these poems especially moving is their sense of impending doom, the increasing despair and hopelessness in the face of ever-new injustices and sufferings for which there's no easy answer... Only in lyric poetry, as fine as Gjuzel's, can a reliable historical record be found of what it is like to live with great evil." ~ From the Introduction by Charles Simic
