 The main theme relates his adventures while crossing the Atlantic ocean alone in an open boat. The voyage took place in 1973 but the book wasn't published until 2005. In addition, the book covers earlier experiences voyaging along the French canals and down the Mediterranean coast to Gibraltar as well as a 21-day voyage to the Canary Islands. He finishes by describing his life after sailing and the continuing desire to set out again. The author is also a bit of a poet and dedicated the following poem to Kerstin, his Swedish muse. "Through this life I wander, Watching all the time, Checking with my inmost self, Should this one be mine. I don’t want the make up, Or silly pouting games, Or giggling insignificance, These birds are all the same. My search is for my woman, A person whole and real, A living loving adult, Not merely sex appeal. Perhaps you are the one my love, I would that it was so, If we can find that this be true, I’ll never let you go."
