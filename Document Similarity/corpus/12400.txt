 Legendary producer Steve Gallop, suddenly down on his luck, is seduced by the charms of a beautiful showbiz columnist, Randi Lester, who’s betting she can improve Gallop’s Broadway track record with a musical based on the life of Frank Sinatra. The idea is to attract front page attention around the world; hundreds of Sinatra wannabes swamp Gallop’s offices. Investors plead for a piece of the action. Not among the pleading masses is mobster Joey Fingers, whose “family” knew Frank, and who naturally expects to bankroll the entire show. Opening night, it looks like curtains for the whole cast until Joey gets an offer he can’t refuse.
