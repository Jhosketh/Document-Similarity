 The village of Winterhaven in the Nentir Vale is being menaced by kobold raiders. The players are ambushed by these kobolds on their way to Winterhaven; upon arrival at Winterhaven they are asked to clean out the kobold's nest. The players soon discover the kobolds are a pawn of Kalarel, a priest of Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath. Kalarel is lairing at a local ruined keep which contains a long-sealed rift to the Shadowfell, a plane of shadow and undeath; he plans to open this rift to connect the material world to Orcus' temple in the Shadowfell and thereby unleash an army of undead upon the unsuspecting region. The players journey to the keep and descend through its crypts, resulting in a final climactic confrontation with Kalarel.
