 What should the librarian do when a lion shows up for story hour? Well, as long as he follows the rules, he is welcome. Each day he shows up early to help the librarian with licking stamps, dusting books, and doing anything else she needs. Everything is wonderful until the librarian falls. What's the lion to do? He knows that he is not allowed to roar, but Miss Merriweather needs help. For her, the lion breaks the rule and lets out his loudest roar. After helping his friend, he sadly leaves knowing that he has broken the library's rules.
