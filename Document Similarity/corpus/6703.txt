The Lord Temporal Rughlor returned from the wider world to settle at Ffenargh Manor, Lorge, with a radiant young wife, Nuala. However, her beauty hid a will for evil and a hunger for the forgotten lore of an ancient wizard buried below Lorge. Rughlor discovered his wife’s evil and destroyed her and himself, and Lorge was abandoned. But Nuala’s treacherous beauty, even as a distorted tale, fascinated another scion of Ffenargh Manor, Miles D’Arcy, who, with the aid of a thief and one of Eylea’s strange relics, found and resurrected the sorceress. He completed her last terrible spell, causing his own doom, and embroiled a group of powerful adventurers in Nuala’s plot to gain allies for her bid for power in the Ffenargh. Nuala now plans to use these adventurers and her own new powers to overthrow the creaky clerical hierarchy of Eylea and rule the Ffenargh. The adventure includes statistics for new monsters, the slime golem, and the life-bane duplicates.
