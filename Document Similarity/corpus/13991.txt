 Thinkers of the East consists of a series of anecdotes and brief recorded conversations between thinkers and questioners, mingled with occasional extracts, stories and legends (including "The Legend of Nasrudin"). The preface asserts that the bookâ€™s contents are "arranged in a manner commanded by the tradition and not by superficialist obsessional arranging." As the book's subtitle Studies in Experientialism suggests, these illustrate Sufi thinking in action, rather than in theory. On the principle that it is for the reader to dwell, not the author, the narratives are related with a deliberate economy: enough detail to provoke thought, but too little to flood it.
