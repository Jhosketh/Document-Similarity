 Author Ben Peek recounts his past relationships, musings, and life events through various alphabetical blog posts, categorised like an encyclopaedia. Whilst many of the posts interconnect to form one event stretched out over time, many are stand alone passages about seemingly random topics. However, a large contingent of the posts are about other authors who have committed plagiarism, fraud, or somehow faked their writing. Since the novel does not have a traditional linear storyline, many of the plots are fragmented and need to be pieced together, or require rereading past entires. Other sub plots of the novel include his former relationship with "R" and the abortion R gets, his past (from the school-age death of his father to recent jobs), the death of "G" in a car accident, and other friends and acquaintances he meets in his life.
