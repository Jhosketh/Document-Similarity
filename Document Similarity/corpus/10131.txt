 The plot is the same as that of the book, though there were some modifications to minor facts. Some character's appearances were not exactly the same as noted in the book, most notably the fact that Captain Holly Short's hair is longer than described in the book, and a darker brown, as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book. The graphic novel also does not contain many word balloons, showing each character's story in first-person. A graphic novel for the second book in the series, The Arctic Incident, was created and released in 2009. Again the plot was the same as that of the book with the same amount of modifications. A graphic novel for the third book, The Eternity Code, is set for release in 2012.
