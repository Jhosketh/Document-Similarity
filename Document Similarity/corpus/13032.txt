 A dark and disturbing novel about the effects of wrongful imprisonment, the story sees Philip Carter, a sweet natured and na√Øve young man sentenced to six years in jail for fraud, a crime he did not commit. Upon his release, those who knew him best are shocked by the complete change in his personality; the gentle man they once knew has become a violent, drug-abusing depressive, so much so that restoring his faith in humanity could prove a struggle.
