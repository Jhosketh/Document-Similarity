 The book narrates Allied deception strategy on the Western Front for the years of 1943 and 1944. It particularly focuses on the strategic Operation Bodyguard and the events leading up the invasion of Normandy. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of the successful deception work Dudley Clarke was achieving in north Africa. As a result they established the London Controlling Section; with a department broad powers, under colonel John Bevan, to plan deception strategy in Europe. Bodyguard of Lies follows Bevan's work in creating a deception plan to cover the Allied invasion of Normandy. Brown discusses the fictional First US Army Group, a unit of Operation Bodyguard under General George Patton, referring to it as "the greatest charade in history".
