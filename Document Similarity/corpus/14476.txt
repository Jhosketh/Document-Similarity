 One spring day in the forests of Minnesota, a litter of five is born into a wolf pack led by King and his mate Silver. Of the six, five pups are of regular size: Leader, Sniffer, Runner, Thinker and Helper and Hunter. The last pup looked much smaller than the others and his mother gave him the name Runt, much to King's disappointment. As Runt grows older, he still is smaller than the others but grows over time. At one point in Runt's life, he and Thinker leave the pack, a porcupine comes along and shoots them with quills. Runt was hit, and Thinker got hit in the eye, They tried to go home and when they did Thinker had died soon later. King was so angry and sad. He thought he would be renamed twice; one time he though he would be renamed "Brave One" when he howled at the humans, and the other time he thought he would be "Provider" when he brings back the tail of a cow. In the end he is named "Singer" for all the times he sang when he was happy, lonely or sad.
