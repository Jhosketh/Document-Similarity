 The novel takes place during the first season, and chronicles the activities of Hiro Nakamura, a young man with the ability to stop time and experience time travel, after he transports himself back in time (as seen in the episode "Six Months Ago") in hopes of saving the life of Charlene "Charlie" Andrews, a waitress with enhanced memory, with whom Hiro has fallen in love, but who is destined to die at the hands of super-powered serial killer, Sylar.
