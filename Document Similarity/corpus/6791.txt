 The novel begins with the main character, Lupe Gomez, as a young and overall naive girl, who lives with her mother, Doña Guadalupe and her other sisters and brother in a ramada in the "Rain of Gold" valley. The family makes a living by selling breakfast to the local miners and washing their clothes. There is a group of colorful miners and most of them have problems with drinking and gambling. The village suffers repeated raids by various factions of the Mexican Revolution and ultimately the brazen Doña Guadalupe manages to protect her daughters and son without incident. Eventually Lupe encounters a man she simply calls "my colonel", a charismatic and romantic figure that Lupe seemingly falls in love with. For much of the beginning of the first chapter of the story she compares the things she enjoys in life to the Colonel, unaware of the fact that he is married to another woman and is nearly two decades older than she is. Swayed by the religious devotion of the Gomez family, the Colonel has them look after his young wife, Socorro who is pregnant with a child. While away on an escort mission of mined gold the Colonel is attacked and killed, Subsequently the rebel fighters who slay him return to the box canyon and dominate the residents. They are a suspicious group and accuse Lupe's brother Victoriano of stealing gold from the mine and they try to hang him as an example to others. He is saved by his mother who hands him a gun after she told the rebels that she was giving him his last prayer, but before Victoriano is able to escape, he shoots and kills La Liebre, the leader, who was attempting to kill Guadalupe. Afterwards, La Liebre's second in command orders Guadalupe to be hanged, but is stopped by the town's people gathering in a mob to stop them. Shortly after the violence the towns people start to leave the city en masse to escape the violence of the Mexican revolution.
