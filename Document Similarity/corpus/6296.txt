 Pancho, also known as Darn Cat or DC, is in the habit of prowling the neighborhood at night. One night he returns home with a wristwatch round his neck. It is determined that the watch belongs to a bank teller who is being held hostage by bank robbers. The FBI put surveillance on the cat in the hope he will lead them to the kidnappers. They are helped and hampered by Pancho's human family and their neighbors.
