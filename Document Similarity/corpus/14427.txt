 Twitter Power begins with a review of social media and the rise of microblogging â€” the practice of posting very short messages for public view. The book then talks the user through the registration procedure; offers design suggestions for the profile page; offers advice on building a following; describes the messages themselves and how to write them; discusses ways to connect with customers and team members on Twitter; and describes how companies are using Twitter to build their brands and drive behavior.
