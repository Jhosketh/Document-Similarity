 In this dramatic tale of a girl gone missing, Harry's multilayered novel explores familial relationships and the nature of truth. This award-winning Australian writer opens her story with sisters Annie and Grace squeezing in one last game of "Tracking" with their dad at the seashore, the beach by Point Nepean. There is a storm coming and it is getting dark. Annie, younger by eleven months and more agile than her sister, Grace, scrambles up the side of a steep hill while Grace struggles when suddenly the ground falls away. Hampered by bad weather, the search is further thwarted by the police's conviction that the young man who found Grace's backpack on the beach may have had something to do with her disappearance.
