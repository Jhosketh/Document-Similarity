 Moo decides to create "love poems for the needy". So Minnie and Moo dress up as cupids. The cows have just the right outfits in the barn. Dressed up as cupids, they use Moo's poems to bring love to the barnyard. The poems do not always end up in the right hands, claws, or hooves. Farmer John thinks that the cows was the one sending the poetry. His wife replied that cows can't write.
