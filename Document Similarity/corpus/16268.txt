 The book is the first examination and exploration of literary works from, or otherwise focused on, the islands of Orkney in Scotland. The published works of key Orcadian poets and novelists such as George Mackay Brown and Edwin Muir are prominently assessed. Hall also evaluates the myriad influences on the development of literature in Orkney, exploring the role of the archipelago's Nordic roots and its historical reliance on fishing, farming and foreign trade.
