 Cary's head is such a mess, which is why she keeps it hidden under her floppy Audrey Hepburn hat. Her best friend Rad &mdash; who only she can see &mdash; speaks to her in only song lyrics. Not even her boyfriend Danny knows what kind of things go through her head. He especially is oblivious to the fact that Cary has strong feelings for a girl named Wendy. Wendy has bright green hair and "hard-candy sadness in her eyes". Cary thinks that this sexy and mysterious girl could love her just as much as her boyfriend Danny does. The only problem, is that Wendy happens to be Cary's boyfriend Danny's twin sister.
