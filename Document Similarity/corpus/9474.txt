 The book is about the struggle of the narrator (who seems very much like the author himself) to annihilate Désiré Nisard, a French author and critic (1806–1888). One of the characteristics of Nisard that so infuriates Chevillard's narrator is the fact that the critic so loathed the burgeoning modern French literature of his times. As Nisard considered that only classicism had a value, Chevillard's book can also be considered a form of meta-criticism upon contemporary trends in Literary criticism.
