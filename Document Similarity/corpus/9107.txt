 Gunther Gerhardt, called the German T. E. Lawrence, and the third most sought-after Nazi war criminal after Adolf Eichmann and Martin Bormann, plots with the Red Chinese to destabilize the Middle East by raids into Israel disguised as Syrians, and vice versa. His plot is revealed by a defector who, although killed, leaves behind a bullet with a micro-engraved message. AXE teams up with Shin-Bet to track down Gerhardt. A beautiful Israeli agent is paired with Nick Carter, and the two negotiate with a Bedouin tribe to scout around. Gerhardt finds out about this from an informer, and bombs the encampment. Carter rallies the survivors, and together they ambush the party sent to make sure everyone was dead. With the radio they recover, they call in jets and paratroopers to destroy the raiders. Gerhardt is killed, but not before he kills the Israeli agent.
