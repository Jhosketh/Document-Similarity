 The story is based on a variety of animals living together in a homestead, and it revolves around a hare called Jack, who works tirelessly to safeguard the wellbeing of his immediate family and that of the animal clan. There was very little contact and mistrust between the animals and human beings. Because much of Jackâ€™s focus was on protecting the animals from humans, he was not prepared for an upheaval from within the animal clan. When that upheaval did come a power struggle resulted with Jack eventually becoming the king of the jungle.
