 As the Albigensian crusade draws to its bloody conclusion, men inflict savage brutalities on each other in the name of religion. Forced to temporarily abandon ship, the TARDIS crew find their lives intertwined with warring Templars, crusaders and heretics. While the Doctor begins a murder investigation in a besieged fortress, Bernice finds herself drawn to an embittered mercenary who has made the hereticsâ€™ fight his own. And both time travellers realize that to leave history unchanged they may have to sacrifice far more than their lives.
